,keynote,Miko Pawlikowski,1,1,SRE Author,Miko Pawlikowski.png,https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikolajpawlikowski/,,@mikopawlikowski,,Keynote: 7 Deadly Traps of SRE,"Site Reliability Engineering was never meant to be about firefighting, yet too many teams find themselves stuck in an endless cycle of pages, postmortems, and quick fixes. Why? Because SRE is full of hidden traps — patterns that look like best practices on the surface but slowly erode reliability, burn out engineers, and stall progress.

In this talk, we’ll expose the 7 Deadly Traps of SRE, from the obsession with chasing “five nines,” to the cult of on-call heroism, to the false comfort of tooling and checklists. For each trap, we’ll unpack why it’s so seductive, how it quietly sabotages your team, and what to do instead.

You’ll walk away with a clearer lens on the pitfalls holding SRE organizations back, and a practical playbook to help your team escape firefighting mode and reclaim the true purpose of SRE: building systems - and cultures - that are resilient, scalable, and human-friendly.",,"Miko Pawlikowski is an SRE Author and a platform engineer at Quadrature. He has led large-scale infrastructure and SRE initiatives at Citadel and Bloomberg, with deep expertise in Kubernetes, cloud computing, and chaos engineering.

This talk shares real world lessons applying SRE principles, SLIs, SLOs, error budgets, and on-call models across multiple cloud providers. We explore what breaks when a single-cloud assumption fails and the patterns that ensure reliability.",,"I am a Principal Engineer with Oracle,  specializing in MultiCloud Engineering for Oracle Databases. I have led the design and operation of Oracle Databases spanning AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), and private cloud environments, with a strong focus on reliability, observability, marketplace integration and operational excellence."
