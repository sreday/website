,keynote,Miko Pawlikowski,1,1,SRE Author,Miko Pawlikowski.png,https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikolajpawlikowski/,,@mikopawlikowski,,Keynote: 7 Deadly Traps of SRE,"Site Reliability Engineering was never meant to be about firefighting, yet too many teams find themselves stuck in an endless cycle of pages, postmortems, and quick fixes. Why? Because SRE is full of hidden traps — patterns that look like best practices on the surface but slowly erode reliability, burn out engineers, and stall progress.

In this talk, we’ll expose the 7 Deadly Traps of SRE, from the obsession with chasing “five nines,” to the cult of on-call heroism, to the false comfort of tooling and checklists. For each trap, we’ll unpack why it’s so seductive, how it quietly sabotages your team, and what to do instead.

You’ll walk away with a clearer lens on the pitfalls holding SRE organizations back, and a practical playbook to help your team escape firefighting mode and reclaim the true purpose of SRE: building systems - and cultures - that are resilient, scalable, and human-friendly.",,"Miko Pawlikowski is an SRE Author and a platform engineer at Quadrature.

This talk shares real world lessons applying SRE principles, SLIs, SLOs, error budgets, and on-call models across multiple cloud providers. We explore what breaks when a single-cloud assumption fails and the patterns that ensure reliability.",,"I am a Principal Engineer with Oracle,  specializing in MultiCloud Engineering for Oracle Databases. I have led the design and operation of Oracle Databases spanning AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), and private cloud environments, with a strong focus on reliability, observability, marketplace integration and operational excellence."

Deploying 500GB-plus models into disconnected, resource-constrained environments—such as air-gapped critical infrastructure—exposes fundamental limits in today’s containerization and delivery patterns. Docker layers time out, container registries collapse under load, and application startup times stretch beyond 45 minutes, rendering traditional approaches impractical.

In this talk, I’ll walk through a battle-tested architecture designed to break this “physics versus physics” deadlock. The approach reframes how we package and deliver large language models at the edge by decoupling lightweight inference engines from massive model weights using OCI Artifacts, enabling far more flexible deployment strategies. I’ll also introduce a sideloading ingress pattern that bypasses container registries entirely, injecting model data directly from object storage to eliminate registry bottlenecks during large, concurrent transfers. Finally, I’ll share a practical quantization decision matrix that makes it possible to run 70B-parameter models within the constraints of a single A100 GPU.

This is not a theoretical exploration. The architecture was validated in production during Exercise Mobility Guardian 2025, where it powered GenAI workloads on a GDC appliance in fully disconnected, zero-internet environments. Attendees will leave with concrete patterns and lessons learned for deploying large-scale generative models where bandwidth, connectivity, and startup time are non-negotiable constraints.",,"I specialize in AI infrastructure and edge reliability at Google based on SF Bay Area, currently focusing on solving the ""Sovereignty Paradox"" for secure environments. My work sits at the intersection of SRE, platform engineering, and critical infrastructure resilience."
