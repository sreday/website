While many developers find it easier to get started in the closed source ecosystem, they quickly realize it is ultimately more expensive, inefficient, and doesn’t have the security and controls required for their applications. Alternatively, open source models have quickly caught up to their closed counterparts and now deliver a cheaper and just as accurate solution that provides organizations with the security they need to run their operations.
In addition, the pace of the open source community is iterating at speeds that are beyond belief and not only improving the accuracy of these models, but making them run even faster, especially on hardware that is better suited for AI beyond the GPU. With new open source models dropping every week and an active community fine-tuning even better versions daily, open source is making AI a commodity, with a wide range of cloud services for developers to choose from that make it even easier for them to use.
Join Amit Kushwaha, Director of AI Engineering, SambaNova, as he breaks down for attendees the advantages of open-source models, why they are critical for fast product iteration, and how organizations can use them to tap into the best minds globally, accelerate their pace of innovation, and position themselves to shape industry standards while continuously advancing enterprise-grade solutions.",,"Amit Kushwaha is the Director of AI Engineering at SambaNova Systems, leading the development and implementation of AI solutions that leverage SambaNova's differentiated hardware.

The Rise of AI Agents,"SREs are the guardians of reliability — we build for failover, redundancy, and scale. But in today’s AI-native systems, there’s a quiet shift happening: automation scripts, AI-driven agents, and machine identities are running critical operations with increasing autonomy.

They auto-remediate incidents, make scaling decisions, deploy configurations, and even patch systems — often with elevated permissions and little human oversight.

**But here’s the problem:**

- What happens when these agents act on bad data?  
- Or when a misconfiguration triggers a cascade of failures?  
- Who holds accountability when an over-permissioned automation silently breaks production?

In this session, I will expose the blind spot most SRE teams don’t realize they have — the growing influence of non-human actors in reliability engineering. I will share real-world examples of automation gone wrong, highlight how over-trusted machine identities quietly amplify risk, and explain why SREs need a governance mindset toward automation.

**I will discuss:**

- The evolving role of AI agents and automation in SRE workflows  
- How machine identities can quietly become single points of failure  
- Why over-permissioned bots and lack of observability threaten reliability  
- Practical steps for introducing identity governance, privilege boundaries, and automation observability into SRE practices  
- How to chaos-engineer for AI agents and validate fail-safes  

This is not a *security talk* — it’s a **reality check** for SREs operating in environments where automation does more than assist; it decides. If you are an SRE, platform engineer, or operations lead, this talk will challenge you to rethink your approach before your AI helpers become your biggest liability.

Logs in one place, metrics in another, both losing context? At ClickHouse, we faced this challenge at a massive scale. Our solution was to abandon the traditional model and embrace a new philosophy: store everything, aggregate nothing.
This talk charts our journey to 100 PB and 500 trillion rows, centered on the concept of ""wide events."" Instead of shipping a simple log message and a separate, pre-aggregated metric, we store a single, context-rich event containing every possible dimension. This shift from three pillars to a single warehouse of high-cardinality telemetry was a game-changer.
The key to this model is using ClickHouse itself as our observability backend. This unlocks unbounded query flexibility through full SQL. When an engineer asks ""what's the p95 pod replacement time after termination?"", we don't say ""let me ship a new metric."" We write a SQL query.
This talk will cover:
The Wide-Event Philosophy: Why logging rich, structured events is more powerful than juggling separate logs and metrics, and how it defeats cardinality fears.
Unbounded SQL-based Querying: We’ll show real-world examples of complex diagnostic queries (like using ASOF JOIN to correlate disparate Kubernetes events) that are impossible in traditional log-search tools.
The Enabler - SysEx: How our custom, high-performance exporter made this firehose of wide-event data technically and financially viable, handling 20x the volume of OTel with 90% less CPU.
Beyond Dashboards: How this approach allows us to use data science tools like Plotly and Jupyter directly on our observability data for deeper, more flexible analysis.

OpenTelemetry,"Observability is the cornerstone of reliable systems. It lets teams identify and resolve issues before they impact a broader group of users. Yet building an ideal observability stack is far from easy. It demands time and effort, instrumenting every app, service, and component that emits telemetry. Many teams default to “Store’em All - just in case”, logs that no one reads, traces that no one queries, metrics that never inform action. The result? Costs escalate, operational clarity fades, and ROI on observability tends to plateau or even decline.

Continuous Deployment was implemented from day one, enabling dozens of automated releases per week with minimal overhead. This delivery setup was tightly integrated with Continuous Discovery practices  - customer interviews, lightweight experiments, and outcome-driven KPIs - to ensure engineering velocity translated into real product value. Together, these practices created a compounding feedback loop that accelerated product–market fit, improved competitive positioning, and drove measurable financial results. The session will cover the tools, processes, and cultural choices that made this possible, in a journey that ultimately led to a successful private equity exit in under four years.",,"I'm the Co-Founder and CTO of countX, a SaaS platform that enables SMEs to navigate cross-border e-commerce with ease by automating VAT compliance, accounting, and reporting.
