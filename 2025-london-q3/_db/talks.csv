In this talk, we‚Äôll explore how SRE teams can benefit from a more modular approach to observability‚Äîone inspired by the evolution of Business Intelligence. Just as BI stacks evolved to separate ETL, data warehouses, and dashboards, observability stacks can be designed around clear boundaries: interoperable tools, technology-neutral query layers, and plug-and-play storage.
You‚Äôll learn why decoupled observability architecture is essential for cost control, agility, and tool flexibility‚Äîand how to move toward a stack that meets the real-world needs of today‚Äôs SRE teams.",,"Peter Marshall is a technology leader and community builder with a background in developer relations, data architecture, and digital transformation.

Logs in one place, metrics in another, both losing context? At ClickHouse, we faced this challenge at a massive scale. Our solution was to abandon the traditional model and embrace a new philosophy: store everything, aggregate nothing.
This talk charts our journey to 100 PB and 500 trillion rows, centered on the concept of ""wide events."" Instead of shipping a simple log message and a separate, pre-aggregated metric, we store a single, context-rich event containing every possible dimension. This shift from three pillars to a single warehouse of high-cardinality telemetry was a game-changer.
The key to this model is using ClickHouse itself as our observability backend. This unlocks unbounded query flexibility through full SQL. When an engineer asks ""what's the p95 pod replacement time after termination?"", we don't say ""let me ship a new metric."" We write a SQL query.
This talk will cover:
The Wide-Event Philosophy: Why logging rich, structured events is more powerful than juggling separate logs and metrics, and how it defeats cardinality fears.
Unbounded SQL-based Querying: We‚Äôll show real-world examples of complex diagnostic queries (like using ASOF JOIN to correlate disparate Kubernetes events) that are impossible in traditional log-search tools.
The Enabler - SysEx: How our custom, high-performance exporter made this firehose of wide-event data technically and financially viable, handling 20x the volume of OTel with 90% less CPU.
Beyond Dashboards: How this approach allows us to use data science tools like Plotly and Jupyter directly on our observability data for deeper, more flexible analysis.

Rather than focusing on failure injection alone, we explore how to leverage existing knowledge, validate known truths, and foster confidence in complex systems.

In the first part, we deconstruct common myths around Chaos Engineering and reframe its core principles. Learn how aligning chaos practices with reliability goals can transform the way your organization perceives and applies these techniques‚Äîby emphasizing structured validation over blind experimentation.

The second part brings theory into practice with a hands-on framework that reimagines chaos experiments as self-feeding, iterative loops‚Äîmirroring the scientific method.

OpenTelemetry,"Observability is the cornerstone of reliable systems. It lets teams identify and resolve issues before they impact a broader group of users. Yet building an ideal observability stack is far from easy. It demands time and effort, instrumenting every app, service, and component that emits telemetry. Many teams default to ‚ÄúStore‚Äôem All - just in case‚Äù, logs that no one reads, traces that no one queries, metrics that never inform action. The result? Costs escalate, operational clarity fades, and ROI on observability tends to plateau or even decline. So, shouldn‚Äôt we be asking ourselves: are we really investing in observability, or just paying for some distributed noise?

The issue isn‚Äôt lack of telemetry; it‚Äôs unchecked volume without purpose. This talk explores the telemetry pipeline as a strategy to take back control. At the OpenTelemetry Collector level, we can filter, transform, sample, redact sensitive data, and route telemetry with intent. The goal is to extract clear business value from every signal and every dollar spent. By aligning observability with outcomes, we get an adaptive, efficient, and cost-aware setup.

But in today‚Äôs AI-native systems, there‚Äôs a quiet shift happening: automation scripts, AI-driven agents, and machine identities are running critical operations with increasing autonomy.

They auto-remediate incidents, make scaling decisions, deploy configurations, and even patch systems ‚Äî often with elevated permissions and little human oversight.

**But here‚Äôs the problem:**

- What happens when these agents act on bad data?  
- Or when a misconfiguration triggers a cascade of failures?  
- Who holds accountability when an over-permissioned automation silently breaks production?

- How machine identities can quietly become single points of failure  
- Why over-permissioned bots and lack of observability threaten reliability  
- Practical steps for introducing identity governance, privilege boundaries, and automation observability into SRE practices  
- How to chaos-engineer for AI agents and validate fail-safes
