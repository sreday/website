Why? Because SRE is full of hidden traps — patterns that look like best practices on the surface but slowly erode reliability, burn out engineers, and stall progress.

In this talk, we’ll expose the 7 Deadly Traps of SRE, from the obsession with chasing “five nines,” to the cult of on-call heroism, to the false comfort of tooling and checklists. For each trap, we’ll unpack why it’s so seductive, how it quietly sabotages your team, and what to do instead.

You’ll walk away with a clearer lens on the pitfalls holding SRE organizations back, and a practical playbook to help your team escape firefighting mode and reclaim the true purpose of SRE: building systems - and cultures - that are resilient, scalable, and human-friendly.",,"Miko Pawlikowski is an SRE Author and a platform engineer at Quadrature.

This tight coupling drives up costs, makes integrations painful, and slows teams down. But it doesn’t have to be this way.
In this talk, we’ll explore how SRE teams can benefit from a more modular approach to observability—one inspired by the evolution of Business Intelligence. Just as BI stacks evolved to separate ETL, data warehouses, and dashboards, observability stacks can be designed around clear boundaries: interoperable tools, technology-neutral query layers, and plug-and-play storage.
You’ll learn why decoupled observability architecture is essential for cost control, agility, and tool flexibility—and how to move toward a stack that meets the real-world needs of today’s SRE teams.",,"Peter Marshall is a technology leader and community builder with a background in developer relations, data architecture, and digital transformation.

,confirmed,Rory Crispin,platform,1,ClickHouse,Rory Crispin.png,https://www.linkedin.com/in/rory-crispin/,,,,Beyond 100 Petabytes: Why We Built a Custom Exporter to Replace Our OTel Pipeline,"Are your observability signals trapped in separate pillars? Logs in one place, metrics in another, both losing context? At ClickHouse, we faced this challenge at a massive scale. Our solution was to abandon the traditional model and embrace a new philosophy: store everything, aggregate nothing.
This talk charts our journey to 100 PB and 500 trillion rows, centered on the concept of ""wide events."" Instead of shipping a simple log message and a separate, pre-aggregated metric, we store a single, context-rich event containing every possible dimension. This shift from three pillars to a single warehouse of high-cardinality telemetry was a game-changer.
The key to this model is using ClickHouse itself as our observability backend. This unlocks unbounded query flexibility through full SQL. When an engineer asks ""what's the p95 pod replacement time after termination?"", we don't say ""let me ship a new metric."" We write a SQL query.
This talk will cover:
The Wide-Event Philosophy: Why logging rich, structured events is more powerful than juggling separate logs and metrics, and how it defeats cardinality fears.
Unbounded SQL-based Querying: We’ll show real-world examples of complex diagnostic queries (like using ASOF JOIN to correlate disparate Kubernetes events) that are impossible in traditional log-search tools.
The Enabler - SysEx: How our custom, high-performance exporter made this firehose of wide-event data technically and financially viable, handling 20x the volume of OTel with 90% less CPU.
Beyond Dashboards: How this approach allows us to use data science tools like Plotly and Jupyter directly on our observability data for deeper, more flexible analysis.
Join us to see how treating observability as a data warehouse problem, powered by ClickHouse, gives you the speed and flexibility to answer any question about your systems, past or present.",,"Rory is a senior engineer on the observability team at ClickHouse, responsible for building and managing a 100+ petabyte observability platform.

The Rise of AI Agents,"SREs are the guardians of reliability — we build for failover, redundancy, and scale. But in today’s AI-native systems, there’s a quiet shift happening: automation scripts, AI-driven agents, and machine identities are running critical operations with increasing autonomy.

They auto-remediate incidents, make scaling decisions, deploy configurations, and even patch systems — often with elevated permissions and little human oversight.

**But here’s the problem:**

- What happens when these agents act on bad data?  
- Or when a misconfiguration triggers a cascade of failures?  
- Who holds accountability when an over-permissioned automation silently breaks production?

In this session, I will expose the blind spot most SRE teams don’t realize they have — the growing influence of non-human actors in reliability engineering. I will share real-world examples of automation gone wrong, highlight how over-trusted machine identities quietly amplify risk, and explain why SREs need a governance mindset toward automation.

**I will discuss:**

- The evolving role of AI agents and automation in SRE workflows  
- How machine identities can quietly become single points of failure  
- Why over-permissioned bots and lack of observability threaten reliability  
- Practical steps for introducing identity governance, privilege boundaries, and automation observability into SRE practices  
- How to chaos-engineer for AI agents and validate fail-safes  

This is not a *security talk* — it’s a **reality check** for SREs operating in environments where automation does more than assist; it decides.

- **Multitenancy Spectrum**  
  Understanding the three dimensions of multitenancy:  
  - *Isolation levels*: physical / logical / none  
  - *Resource sharing*: dedicated / pooled / shared  
  - *Trust boundaries*: zero / partial / full  

- **Flexibility in Practice**  
  How to mix and match different multitenancy models for different teams and workloads.

- **vCluster Deep Dive**  
  How virtual clusters enable this flexibility while maintaining strong isolation boundaries.

- **Real-World Scenarios**  
  Live demo showing how to implement different multitenancy patterns based on actual use cases.

**Key Takeaways**

- Understanding the multitenancy conceptual framework and its three core dimensions  
- Practical patterns for implementing flexible isolation strategies  
- How to choose the right multitenancy model for different team requirements  
- Hands-on experience with vCluster for creating adaptable multitenant environments

**Why This Talk Matters**

Most Kubernetes multitenancy discussions focus on a single approach — either namespace isolation or full cluster isolation. Real-world platforms need **flexibility** to accommodate different teams with varying security, resource, and trust requirements. This talk shows how to build platforms that can adapt to these diverse needs without compromising on security or operational efficiency.

Users are forced to manually correlate across systems, accept duplication, or pay high SaaS bills. But what if observability is just a data problem? One that needs a general-purpose solution instead of purpose-built compromises? This talk argues that true observability requires fast, high-cardinality queries over unsampled data at scale and at low cost. Traditional search and metrics engines were not designed for this, but column-oriented databases are. We introduce ClickStack, a fully open source, OpenTelemetry-native observability stack built around ClickHouse. It provides fast, flexible querying and efficient storage, enabling real-time visibility without compromise.",,"Dale McDiarmid is a Senior Principal Technologist at ClickHouse with over a decade of experience in data infrastructure, performance engineering, and product strategy.

As large language models (LLMs) become embedded in cloud-native apps and infrastructure, a new kind of risk is emerging: data leakage through inference. With the right prompt, an attacker can extract sensitive data, proprietary logic, or even credentials from your model’s responses bypassing traditional cloud and application security. In this talk, we’ll explore real-world examples of prompt injection, model inversion, and inference-time exfiltration attacks. You’ll learn why AI models running in Kubernetes, serverless, or SaaS environments introduce hidden exposure, and what to do about it. Whether you’re a security engineer, cloud architect, DevSecOps lead, or AI/ML practitioner, this session will equip you to recognize and defend against one of the fastest-evolving threats in modern cloud systems. Because in the age of AI, the model doesn’t need to be hacked to become the leak.",,"Meletius Igbokwe is a cybersecurity-focused Modern Workplace Engineer with a strong passion for protecting organizational data and identities in today’s cloud-driven world.
