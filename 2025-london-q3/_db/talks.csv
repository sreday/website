I created the open-source project prompt-eng-gsm8k-gpt3.5-dspy, where I used DSPy to automate prompt creation for the GSM8K benchmark and developed my Enhanced Prolog-style reasoning method, boosting GPT-3.5 accuracy from 55.0% (zero-shot) to 74.5%.
I have hands-on experience testing prompt strategies — zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, self-consistency, Prolog-style, and DSPy-optimized — across multiple models, including GPT-3.5, LLaMA-2-7B-Chat-HF, and Qwen. My work combines reproducible code, measurable results, and practical workflows that bridge research and real-world applications.
Outside AI, I enjoy doodling, playing badminton, and mentoring peers in AI projects. And while I don’t have a definitive favorite member of One Direction, I’ll say Harry Styles for his creativity — a trait I also bring to my AI experiments."

For implementing these kinds of use cases, you broadly have three options:
- **Cloud solutions** – send your data to an AI model running on a powerful server in the cloud - **On-device solutions** – download a (possibly large) model file to the client and run it locally - **Shared models** – use models built into a device or browser (the focus of this talk) On the Chrome team, we’re proposing a number of APIs that we and partners we’ve worked with think would be worthwhile to have as common Web platform APIs. In this talk, I’ll: - Give an overview of these APIs - Briefly demo some implementations in Chrome - Open the floor for general discussion and feedback",,Thierno currently works as a Web Ecosystem Engineer @Google focusing on on integrating Gemini into Google Chrome and making Web AI accessible for everyone.

However, it requires designing APIs with specific patterns that make them easy for AI agents to use.Your organisation likely already has pre-existing APIs with machine readable schemas, like GraphQL or OpenAPI (REST). While they expose useful business data and capabilities, these schemas are not optimised for consumption by AI agents. Still, they have mature frameworks around them and importantly – are already implemented.In this talk we'll share what we learned at Isometric when building a translation layer between GraphQL and MCP. We optimised for avoiding duplicate work and making the most of existing tooling built into the GraphQL server, while at the same time ensuring that the end result follows all the MCP server design best practices and can be effectively used by AI agents.Our internal GraphQL server has more than 800 types, 100 top-level query fields and 200 mutations. We'll show how we leveraged GraphQL schema introspection, query templates and complexity heuristics to distill this large API surface into a small, but scalable, set of MCP tools.You’ll learn about practical strategies for exposing your existing APIs to AI agents without rewriting the entire API layer. We'll discuss specific challenges like handling GraphQL's infinite nesting problem and demonstrate how complex GraphQL queries get transformed into simpler, AI-friendly MCP tools.",,"Konrad Komorowski is a software engineer at Isometric, working on carbon removal credit verification.

AI is already being trialled in areas such as digital triage, clinical decision support, mood monitoring, and therapy-adjacent tools, raising important questions about efficacy, safety, and integration with professional practice and the UK regulator NICE is appraising two interventions with LLM or AI components.

Alongside these developments, the ways in which lay people engage with AI also merit attention. Through everyday prompting, users can elicit supportive reflections or structure wellbeing routines, but poorly framed question alongside generic model training and the absence of ""safety rails"" may produce misleading or unsafe outputs or delay seeking professional help when necessary.

The session will situate these practices within broader debates about ethics and governance. Key issues include clinical reliability, data privacy, cultural bias, and the boundary between self-help tools and regulated interventions. By examining both institutional and informal uses of AI, this session highlights the promise of scalable, accessible support, while emphasising the need for robust evidence, regulation, and ethical safeguards in this rapidly evolving field.

Current AI systems are fragile: prompts are brittle, agents are isolated, and orchestration often collapses into spaghetti glue code. To unlock the next leap, we need to move beyond tricks and hacks and start thinking in systems.

This talk explores a graph-native approach to reasoning and orchestration: - Knowledge Hypergraphs as context engines that capture relations, causality, and logic — the missing symbolic backbone for LLMs. - A layered reasoning model that navigates from atomic concepts through compositional reasoning, contextual integration, meta-reasoning, and finally external knowledge integration. - Graph-native multi-agent orchestration, where agents collaborate using strategies that mirror real-world organizations: sequential pipelines, hierarchical teams, debates, juries, and emergent coordination. - Agentic governance policies that provide enterprises with what they actually need: compliance, auditability, and trust.

Instead of chaining prompts, we get composable reasoning: agents dynamically choosing strategies, grounding their outputs in knowledge graphs, and collaborating under policy-driven rules.
