While many developers find it easier to get started in the closed source ecosystem, they quickly realize it is ultimately more expensive, inefficient, and doesn’t have the security and controls required for their applications. Alternatively, open source models have quickly caught up to their closed counterparts and now deliver a cheaper and just as accurate solution that provides organizations with the security they need to run their operations.

In addition, the pace of the open source community is iterating at speeds that are beyond belief and not only improving the accuracy of these models, but making them run even faster, especially on hardware that is better suited for AI beyond the GPU. With new open source models dropping every week and an active community fine-tuning even better versions daily, open source is making AI a commodity, with a wide range of cloud services for developers to choose from that make it even easier for them to use.

Join Amit Kushwaha, Director of AI Engineering, SambaNova, as he breaks down for attendees the advantages of open-source models, why they are critical for fast product iteration, and how organizations can use them to tap into the best minds globally, accelerate their pace of innovation, and position themselves to shape industry standards while continuously advancing enterprise-grade solutions.",,"Amit Kushwaha is the Director of AI Engineering at SambaNova Systems, leading the development and implementation of AI solutions that leverage SambaNova's differentiated hardware.

In this talk, we’ll go beyond the buzzwords to explore what it truly takes to embed security into modern software delivery.

We’ll start by demystifying the DevSecOps tooling landscape—covering the full acronym bingo (SAST, DAST, SCA, CSPM, etc.), highlighting major vendors, and sharing a practical framework for choosing the right tools for your environment. But that’s just the beginning.

We’ll explore SDLC maturity models and how to create a DevSecOps roadmap that aligns with your organization's goals. You’ll also learn how to approach organizational change with principles borrowed from change management—because tooling alone won’t get you there.

Finally, we’ll focus on the human side: the social skills you need to overcome resistance, influence stakeholders, and craft internal communications that get attention and drive adoption.

While LLMs and AI agents grab headlines, it's APIs that power their ability. Behind every AI-generated insight, recommendation, or automated task is an API call connecting the model to the tools, services, and data it needs to get the job done.

As AI systems evolve from passive assistants to autonomous agents capable of decision-making and execution, APIs have become the essential infrastructure enabling this transformation. They are no longer just integration tools—they are the action layer of AI.

In this talk, we’ll explore how APIs are shaping the future of intelligent automation. Using real-world examples from across industries, we’ll examine how companies are leveraging APIs to orchestrate multi-step workflows, access real-time data, and drive operational efficiency with AI. Organizations with robust, scalable, and discoverable API ecosystems will not only keep up—they’ll lead. If AI is the recipe, APIs are the ingredients. It's time we start treating them that way.

**Divine** is an advocate for data on Kubernetes, and a Data on Kubernetes Ambassador.

**Shivadeep**, on the other hand, as an Oracle DBA, traditionally believed that containers and Kubernetes weren't suitable for persistent workloads like databases.

And that’s rightly so because it was originally designed to be stateless. But he didn’t know a lot had changed.

With no prior experience in containers, Kubernetes, or NodeJS, **Shivadeep** embarked on a challenging project to build a scalable Pacman game. This journey not only helped him learn new technologies but also changed his perspective on using Kubernetes for database workloads.

**Shivadeep** discovered why and how Kubernetes is increasingly becoming a popular choice for running databases as well.

**Shivadeep** will start this talk sharing his story of learning and exploration, highlighting:

- How he containerized and deployed the PACMAN Game application on Kubernetes
- How he connected it to an Oracle DB on Container as well as on-prem Oracle database via CMAN

To make the session even more engaging, **Shivadeep** will provide a hands-on opportunity for attendees to try out the Pacman game!

Towards the end of the talk, **Divine** will share how DBAs can evolve to manage databases on Kubernetes.

,confirmed,Mitul Jain,1,1,H&M Group,Mitul Jain.png,https://www.linkedin.com/in/mituljain/,,,,Move from Traditional Ops to Integrated SRE Ops at a Retail organization,"With our traditional operations setup supporting monolithic systems – as the tech implementation scaled, there was a proportionate increase in costs to support and maintain the systems. This had been primarily due to segregation in organization setup to deliver business outcomes. While one part of the tech organization was focused on build, the other part was focused on maintain. With differing goal-post and motivation to deliver around collective business impact, the focus was divergent which led to undesirable customer experience and unsustainable costs.

As the tech landscape became more distributed and decoupled, we saw this as an opportunity to introduce SRE adoption, where we managed to build an integrated setup with product teams and embedded SRE taking full accountability from build to maintain for the product even as the implementation scaled across multiple markets. While this setup has proved to be impactful over the last couple of months, it has been a continuous effort to tie Service Level Indicators and Objectives (SLI/SLO) to Business KPI's thereby showcasing direct impact to business.

It requires a robust sociotechnical system, the dynamic interplay between social and technical components. Our North Star is an engineering culture, built on shared beliefs, practices and behaviours that shape how we operate, solve problems, collaborate, innovate and continuously learn.

But how do we achieve this engineering culture, where innovation and success are driven by collaboration, trust, autonomy, and passion? What is our code of conduct and how does it propel us forward?

In this talk, we will take you through our 5-year journey in Reliability Advocacy. We started out as a group of 10 enthusiastic engineers from different platform and enablement teams who wanted to share knowledge of our reliability product offering and practices across the organization. We are now a household name, run our annual Reliability Event conference which are attended by 300+ engineers every year and our reliability trainings are part of the curriculum for all new joiners and we've guided hundreds of engineers on their path to defining SLIs and SLOs. In part, thanks to our reliability advocates, reliability is now one of our engineering pillars for years to come shaping our organization in the process, raising our general availability rating from 99.54% to 99,87% in the process.
