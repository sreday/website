At large scale — with billions of requests flowing through mission-critical services — reliability must be engineered into the system through autonomous detection, mitigation, and recovery.
In this session, I’ll share how our platform team evolved from traditional observability stacks to an integrated, self-defending resilience architecture that transforms metrics into real-time, automated mitigations.
Key topics include:
Actionable observability: Designing high-fidelity Prometheus instrumentation that surfaces actionable SLO breaches and capacity anomalies — not just vanity metrics.
Closed-loop alerting: Building alert pipelines that automatically trigger mitigations, including traffic shaping, circuit breaking, and dynamic configuration changes.
Continuous delivery at scale: How we implemented fully automated CI/CD pipelines with canary deployments, progressive rollouts, and automatic rollback — eliminating manual gates while preserving production stability.
Dynamic rate limiting: Using adaptive throttling to contain abusive or runaway workloads before they impact critical path services.
Proactive incident response: Real-world learnings from production incidents that shaped our automated safeguards, including post-incident automation improvements and resilience patterns.
Operational trust: Governance strategies for enabling engineers to trust self-healing automation, from progressive rollout policies to guardrails for fail-safe operation.
Attendees will gain a practical blueprint for evolving traditional monitoring into an autonomous resilience layer — with concrete patterns, architectural considerations, and lessons learned operating a high-volume, always-on platform.
Whether you’re modernizing your incident response playbooks, tightening your feedback loops, or scaling continuous delivery for critical systems, you’ll leave with actionable strategies to move beyond dashboards — and build a production environment that can defend itself.
Key Takeaways How to evolve from passive observability to automated corrective action. Designing metrics pipelines that detect and trigger real-time mitigations. Safe automation of deployments at scale without sacrificing reliability. Implementing dynamic safeguards like adaptive rate limiting and circuit breaking. Practical leadership and governance approaches for building trust in self-healing systems.",,"Sureshkumar Karuppuchamy is a technology leader with more than two decades of experience designing and modernizing large-scale, AI-enabled infrastructure for some of the world’s most complex platforms.

This talk provides a comprehensive framework for applying SRE principles to ML inference systems, drawing from hands-on experience scaling platforms that serve billions of daily predictions with sub-100ms latency requirements. We'll explore how to establish meaningful SLIs and SLOs for ML systems, where traditional availability metrics fall short in capturing model performance degradation, data drift, and inference quality issues. Learn practical approaches to incident response for ML platforms, including automated fallback mechanisms, circuit breakers for model failures, and graceful degradation strategies that maintain user experience during outages. The session covers essential reliability patterns including blue-green deployments for model updates, canary releases with statistical significance testing, and rollback strategies that account for model warming and feature pipeline dependencies. We'll examine monitoring and observability strategies that go beyond traditional metrics, incorporating model performance tracking, feature drift detection, and business impact correlation. Infrastructure reliability techniques will be demonstrated through real-world examples: implementing request batching for throughput optimization while maintaining latency SLAs, designing feature stores for consistency and disaster recovery, and orchestrating Kubernetes-based serving infrastructure with proper resource allocation and auto-scaling policies. Critical operational aspects include capacity planning for ML workloads with variable computational requirements, managing dependencies between feature generation pipelines and serving systems, and implementing effective on-call procedures for ML-specific incidents. Attendees will gain practical tools for building resilient ML inference platforms including monitoring dashboards, alerting strategies, and runbook templates.

,confirmed,Aditya Bansal,1,1,Cortex,Aditya Bansal.png,https://www.linkedin.com/in/adbansal/,,,,“We’re Down!” to “We’re Good.” — Shipping observability in 2 weeks,"**Many hyper-growth startups hit a point where the current systems just aren’t enough.**  
Racing toward product–market fit, they skip best practices around observability, monitoring, and alerting—and pay for it later.

This talk is about going from **0 → 1** and protecting your company, team, and customers when the pressure mounts.

**I’ll cover:**

- **Getting started from the ground floor**  
  Foundational work, the three pillars of observability, and—more importantly—how to get hands-on with all three.  
  This won’t be another high-level “logs/traces/metrics” sermon; we’ll actually use them.

- **Building your first monitor, alert, and dashboard**  
  Move to offense: catch full outages, errors, latency spikes, and change alerts *before* your customers do.  
  We’ll touch more than just the “golden signals.”

- **Iterating**  
  Going from 0 → 1 is only the beginning. You’ll need to tune false alarms, coach engineers on response, add new metrics, and prune stale ones—plenty of hidden gotchas here.

Teams often get bogged down by dogma and decision paralysis.  
I’ll share tactics for keeping a **bias toward action** and steadily moving the reliability needle.

*No sales pitch.* I may demo with an APM tool (no affiliations) purely to illustrate what’s possible.
