,confirmed,Kat Gaines,1,1,PagerDuty,Kat Gaines.png,https://www.linkedin.com/in/katgaines/,,,,Staying in your lane: incident response for leaders,"During incident response, every second counts. As a leader, you're expected to have all the answers, and that pressure can make it very tempting to play the hero and take control of the response process. While ""I'll just do it myself"" may seem faster on occasion, this instinct can hinder your team's effectiveness and actually slow down resolution.

We'll explore how you can evolve from a command-and-control manager into a genuinely empowering leader. You'll learn how to maintain composure under pressure while creating space for your team to shine. We'll cover essential frameworks, usable by new managers and individual contributors building incident response processes from scratch as well as experienced leaders looking to level up their approach.

Key takeaways will include:

- How to recognize when you may be over-managing during an incident… and how to empower your team to help you recognize these moments.  
- Building team confidence and ownership in crisis situations.  
- Clear guidelines for when to step in versus step back.  
- Establishing and maintaining clear communication channels.  

Whether you're establishing your first incident response playbook, fine-tuning an existing process, or managing up to help your leaders help you do your best work, you'll leave equipped to help your team handle incidents more effectively – and help you sleep better at night knowing they've got this.",,"Kat leads the Developer Advocacy and Community team at PagerDuty.

,confirmed,Michael Cote,1,1,VMware / Pivotal,Michael Cote.png,https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelcote/,,@cote,,Platform Engineering for Private Cloud,"_Platform engineering_ is the art of building and managing the infrastructure that powers your applications: a mix of cloud, a handful of DevOps, a pinch of SRE, and a thick glaze of product management. While it’s “nothing new,” many organizations are just starting to practice it—and for good reason. But what happens when your platform is running on private cloud?

With around 50% of enterprise apps still running on private clouds, platform engineering for private platforms is surprisingly under-discussed. This talk dives into real-world examples and stories from large organizations tackling this challenge. The hurdles often lie in adapting platform engineering to existing IT stacks and processes—most organizations can’t simply start from scratch, nor would they want to abandon what’s currently driving revenue.

If you support your organization’s apps, platform engineering is something you’ll probably be doing soon. Come learn how your peers are navigating these challenges and share your own experiences.",,"[Michael Cote](https://cote.io/) studies how large organizations get better at building software to run better and grow their business.

In this talk, we will demonstrate an example of how to monitor your GitHub repo using the GitHub Data source plugin that allows you to represent data e.g. open/close issues, Pull n Merge requests, and other various statuses visually in Grafana dashboards and gives a dynamic and interactive view to monitoring for a more adaptable and user-centric dashboard experience either for your personal projects or for the entire team. Later, we see more advanced features to get better observability.

It will be an introduction to the Grafana Dashboards, and also an excellent opportunity to learn more about utilizing advanced visualization options to effectively represent complex data.
