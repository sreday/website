,keynote,Miko Pawlikowski,1,1,SRE Author,Miko Pawlikowski.png,https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikolajpawlikowski/,,@mikopawlikowski,,Keynote: 7 Deadly Traps of SRE,"Site Reliability Engineering was never meant to be about firefighting, yet too many teams find themselves stuck in an endless cycle of pages, postmortems, and quick fixes. Why? Because SRE is full of hidden traps — patterns that look like best practices on the surface but slowly erode reliability, burn out engineers, and stall progress.

In this talk, we’ll expose the 7 Deadly Traps of SRE, from the obsession with chasing “five nines,” to the cult of on-call heroism, to the false comfort of tooling and checklists. For each trap, we’ll unpack why it’s so seductive, how it quietly sabotages your team, and what to do instead.

You’ll walk away with a clearer lens on the pitfalls holding SRE organizations back, and a practical playbook to help your team escape firefighting mode and reclaim the true purpose of SRE: building systems - and cultures - that are resilient, scalable, and human-friendly.",,"Miko Pawlikowski is an SRE Author and a platform engineer at Quadrature.

,keynote,Matt Henderson,1,1,Phoebe,Matt Henderson.png,https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthenderson/,,,,Keynote: The Immune System for Software: Lessons from Biology,"Most reliability work today is still centred on reactive troubleshooting: diagnosing a multitude of alerts, pulling large groups into incidents, and engineers scrambling to understand what’s happening. To truly change that pattern, we need systems that can predict and prevent failures before they occur. Biological immune systems offer a powerful blueprint for how software can defend and ultimately heal itself.

This talk introduces a practical framework for thinking about “software immunity” and highlights the gaps in today’s observability practices.

Innate immunity comes from built-in defences like testing, feature flags, auto-scaling, and circuit breakers — mechanisms that provide immediate, general protection. Adaptive immunity, meanwhile, emerges from AI agents that learn from new data, refine their understanding of system behaviour, and apply those lessons to predict and pre-emptively fix failures

We’ll break down the key ingredients for trustworthy AI agents in reliability: modular reasoning rather than opaque black-box outputs; strong control mechanisms and guardrails; continuous learning from each execution cycle; and graduated autonomy – from suggestions, to human-in-the-loop actions, to fully automated remediation.

The session will include some “under the hood” details on designing AI agents for reliability, with key takeaways for anyone building enterprise-grade AI agents.

,confirmed,Adriana Villela,1,1,Dynatrace,Adriana Villela.png,https://www.linkedin.com/in/adrianavillela/,,,,Observability is a Team Sport!,"Observability may have been a newcomer few years ago, but it's safe to say that it's a pretty well-established part of our tech lives today. But as organizations embrace Observability, they run the risk of creating Yet Another Silo, in much the same way that DevOps created more silos, instead of breaking them.

Reliability can’t happen without Observability, and Observability itself must be looked at holistically. It isn't the responsibility of one single team, but instead weaves its way into multiple teams. In this talk, Adriana dives into the roles and responsibilities that Development, Quality Assurance, CI/CD, and SRE teams when it comes to contributing to the Observability story. Spoiler alert - it's not as straightforward as you might think!

She will also show how an “Observability team”, if not designed and rolled out properly, can take away an organization’s collective responsibility for Observability, and dilute the promise of Observability.",,"Adriana Villela is a Principal Developer Advocate at Dynatrace, where she focuses on cloud native technologies, observability, and helping developers build and operate reliable systems at scale.
