,keynote,Miko Pawlikowski,1,1,SRE Author,Miko Pawlikowski.png,https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikolajpawlikowski/,,@mikopawlikowski,,Keynote: 7 Deadly Traps of SRE,"Site Reliability Engineering was never meant to be about firefighting, yet too many teams find themselves stuck in an endless cycle of pages, postmortems, and quick fixes. Why? Because SRE is full of hidden traps — patterns that look like best practices on the surface but slowly erode reliability, burn out engineers, and stall progress.

In this talk, we’ll expose the 7 Deadly Traps of SRE, from the obsession with chasing “five nines,” to the cult of on-call heroism, to the false comfort of tooling and checklists. For each trap, we’ll unpack why it’s so seductive, how it quietly sabotages your team, and what to do instead.

You’ll walk away with a clearer lens on the pitfalls holding SRE organizations back, and a practical playbook to help your team escape firefighting mode and reclaim the true purpose of SRE: building systems - and cultures - that are resilient, scalable, and human-friendly.",,"Miko Pawlikowski is an SRE Author and a platform engineer at Quadrature. He has led large-scale infrastructure and SRE initiatives at Citadel and Bloomberg, with deep expertise in Kubernetes, cloud computing, and chaos engineering. Passionate about building resilient systems and communities, he brings together engineers worldwide through conferences and media projects."

While Terraform remains the industry standard, its domain-specific language limits flexibility and maintainability at scale.

In this session, Dmitry shares lessons from building production infrastructure at two fast-scaling startups — Fuse and Seamflow — using AWS CDK and Pulumi, frameworks that leverage general-purpose programming languages for infrastructure management. He’ll cover what made these tools more powerful, how they improved testing and reusability, and what teams should know before adopting them.",,"Dmitrii Iniutin is a founding engineer at Seamflow, where he works across the full engineering stack to build and scale core product systems. Before that, he was a lead engineer at Fuse Energy, joining as one of the earliest technical hires and helping the company grow into a global renewable-energy unicorn. He built critical components including the trading desk, billing engine, APIs, notification platform, and the entire infrastructure backbone.
