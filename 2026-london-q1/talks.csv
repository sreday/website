,keynote,Miko Pawlikowski,1,1,SRE Author,Miko Pawlikowski.png,https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikolajpawlikowski/,,@mikopawlikowski,,Keynote: I Was Promised a Beach: Why AI Hasn’t Taken Your Pager (Yet),"By now, the algorithm was supposed to be fixing the outage. According to the hype, SREs should be obsolete, incident management should be fully autonomous, and we should all be collecting Universal Basic Income on a tropical island.

But here we are. The pager is still loud, Kubernetes is still confusing, and the ""magic"" AI just hallucinated a root cause that doesn't exist.

This talk cuts through the noise to look at the actual state of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Site Reliability Engineering. We will move past the fantasy of ""NoOps"" and look at how to use these tools as a force multiplier, not a replacement.

In this session, we will cover:

The Hype Gap: Why LLMs are great at writing boilerplate code but terrible at understanding complex distributed system states.

The Junior Engineer: How to treat ChatGPT/Claude like a smart but inexperienced intern (trust, but verify).

Practical Use Cases: Real workflows for incident summarization, post-mortem generation, and querying logs without tears.

Job Security: Why human intuition and context are still the ultimate availability safeguards.

Come find out how to make AI carry some of the load, even if it can’t buy you that margarita just yet.",,"Miko Pawlikowski is an SRE Author and a platform engineer at Quadrature.

,keynote,Peter Marshall,1,1,Imply,Peter Marshall.png,https://www.linkedin.com/in/petermarshallio/,,,,Keynote: Decoupling Observability for Incident Response at Scale,"On-call incidents don’t fail because teams lack dashboards. They fail because observability systems slow down under real investigative load.

As telemetry volumes grow and retention windows expand, SRE teams are being asked to run deeper, broader investigations—often under time pressure—on platforms that were designed for steady-state monitoring, not bursty incident response. Tightly coupled observability stacks bind storage, compute, and query together, forcing teams to overprovision infrastructure, limit retention, or accept degraded performance during incidents.

In this talk, we’ll explore why decoupling observability architectures is becoming essential for SRE teams operating at scale. Using a real incident investigation workflow, we’ll break down how separating data storage, compute, and interaction layers allows teams to keep fast, reliable monitoring while elastically scaling investigations when incidents occur.

We’ll connect these patterns to lessons learned in other data-intensive systems, but stay grounded in the day-to-day realities of on-call life: faster root cause analysis, fewer tradeoffs during incidents, and observability systems that hold up when you need them most.",,"Peter Marshall is a technology leader and community builder with a background in developer relations, data architecture, and digital transformation.

,keynote,Dewan Ahmed,1,1,Harness,Dewan Ahmed.png,https://www.linkedin.com/in/diahmed/,,,,Keynote: Secure by Default: Building Confidence in AI-Driven Delivery,"The fastest way to break trust in DevSecOps is to automate insecurity at scale. As AI takes a central role in our pipelines, it is time to rethink what ""secure by default"" really means.

In this keynote, Dewan Ahmed will challenge the audience to look beyond vulnerability scanners and compliance gates. He will share a vision for intelligent security by design, where native intelligence within the delivery platform detects not only vulnerable code but risky delivery behavior such as misconfigured environments, suspicious artifact provenance, and drift between source and runtime.

You will walk away with a framework for balancing automation with human oversight and examples from Harness’ work on building verifiable, auditable, AI-native delivery systems. In the new world of DevSecOps, safety is not a step; it is an outcome we continuously learn to improve.",,"Dewan Ahmed is a Principal Developer Advocate at Harness and a Governing Board General Member Representative at the Continuous Delivery Foundation.

,keynote,Matt Henderson,1,1,Phoebe,Matt Henderson.png,https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthenderson/,,,,Keynote: The Immune System for Software: Lessons from Biology,"Most reliability work today is still centred on reactive troubleshooting: diagnosing a multitude of alerts, pulling large groups into incidents, and engineers scrambling to understand what’s happening. To truly change that pattern, we need systems that can predict and prevent failures before they occur. Biological immune systems offer a powerful blueprint for how software can defend and ultimately heal itself.

This talk introduces a practical framework for thinking about “software immunity” and highlights the gaps in today’s observability practices.

Innate immunity comes from built-in defences like testing, feature flags, auto-scaling, and circuit breakers — mechanisms that provide immediate, general protection. Adaptive immunity, meanwhile, emerges from AI agents that learn from new data, refine their understanding of system behaviour, and apply those lessons to predict and pre-emptively fix failures

We’ll break down the key ingredients for trustworthy AI agents in reliability: modular reasoning rather than opaque black-box outputs; strong control mechanisms and guardrails; continuous learning from each execution cycle; and graduated autonomy – from suggestions, to human-in-the-loop actions, to fully automated remediation.

The session will include some “under the hood” details on designing AI agents for reliability, with key takeaways for anyone building enterprise-grade AI agents.

But as organizations embrace Observability, they run the risk of creating Yet Another Silo, in much the same way that DevOps created more silos, instead of breaking them.

Reliability can’t happen without Observability, and Observability itself must be looked at holistically. It isn't the responsibility of one single team, but instead weaves its way into multiple teams. In this talk, Adriana dives into the roles and responsibilities that Development, Quality Assurance, CI/CD, and SRE teams when it comes to contributing to the Observability story.

Then production hits 10x expected traffic during a marketing campaign and everything falls apart. Or maybe not, instead six months of data accumulates, causing the response times to be painfully slow. Load testing, stress testing, soak testing, and spike testing, they all sound similar, but address completely different problems, and most teams only do one, if at all.

This talk breaks down the essential types of performance testing every app and web developer should understand. Learn when to use each approach, what problems they uncover, and how to integrate them into your development workflow without drowning in complexity. We'll cover real-world scenarios where each testing type saves production systems, helping you choose the right weapon for your performance battles.

What you'll learn:
- The differences between load, stress, soak, and spike testing, and when each matters
- Which performance testing types reveal which production problems, before they happen
- How to integrate performance testing into CI/CD without slowing down development and deployments
- Practical criteria for deciding which tests your application actually needs",,Developer Advocate with a background in software engineering.
