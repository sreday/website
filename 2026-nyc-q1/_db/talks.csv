,confirmed,Karen Zhou,1,1,Anthropic,Karen Zhou.png,https://www.linkedin.com/in/karenzhou0/,,,,Building Evaluation Systems for AI Coding Agents at Scale,"As AI coding assistants move from novelty to daily workflow, how do we know they're actually helping? This talk explores the technical and philosophical challenges of evaluating AI coding agents when they're deployed to millions of users.
Turning user feedback into signal: Users complain, report issues, and express frustration—but this unstructured feedback is gold for improving models. I'll discuss approaches for transforming messy real-world feedback into structured evaluation datasets, including clustering techniques and rubric generation for consistent assessment.
Measuring subtle failures: Some problems are easy to benchmark; others are felt more than measured. ""Laziness,"" overconfidence, and instruction-following failures don't show up in traditional evals. I'll share frameworks for detecting these behavioral issues through automated assessment pipelines.
The evaluation bottleneck: In my experience, evaluation infrastructure often becomes the limiting factor for model improvement. I'll discuss why building robust eval systems deserves as much engineering investment as the models themselves, and what that looks like in practice.
Multi-agent architectures and new challenges: As coding agents become more autonomous and collaborative, evaluation gets harder. How do you assess a swarm? What metrics matter when agents coordinate on complex tasks?
Closing the loop: Connecting evaluation back to training through RL and human feedback pipelines—what works, what doesn't, and where the field is heading.",,"Karen is a member of technical staff at Anthropic, where she works on developing product eval, RL environments, and multi-agent product features for Claude Code.

Prior to Anthropic, Karen worked at Meta on large language models."
,confirmed,Suvendu Mohanty,1,1,Amazon,Suvendu Mohanty.png,https://www.linkedin.com/in/suvenduml/,,,,Fine‑Tuning LLMs for Voice‑First Consumer Experiences,"Voice-first consumer devices—smart speakers, wearables, in‑home assistants, and connected appliances—demand language models that are not only accurate, but fast, reliable, and deeply aligned with user expectations in real‑world environments. This talk explores practical methods for fine‑tuning large language models (LLMs) to deliver high‑quality, low‑friction voice interactions at scale.

I will outline a structured approach to supervised fine‑tuning (SFT) for voice-driven use cases, including dataset design strategies that capture conversational latency patterns, prosody-driven intent, and the ambiguities inherent in spoken queries. The session will also address real evaluation challenges: how to measure dialog quality, naturalness, grounding, and long‑horizon task execution when traditional text benchmarks fall short. Particular attention will be given to diagnosing and reducing hallucinations in consumer contexts, where incorrect answers can undermine trust, cause user frustration, or trigger unintended physical-world actions.

Attendees will leave with a clear picture of what it takes to adapt an LLM into a dependable, voice‑native system—from fine‑tuning workflows and guardrail construction to continuous evaluation loops informed by real user behavior. This talk aims to provide a practical roadmap for teams building the next generation of on‑device and cloud‑connected voice experiences.",,"Suvendu is a Senior Machine Learning Engineer on Amazon’s Devices Org, where he leads supervised fine‑tuning and RLHF pipelines for 7 B–470 B‑parameter LLMs. Over 14 years, he has designed large‑scale distributed‑training systems with Megatron‑LM 3‑D parallelism, DeepSpeed ZeRO, PyTorch FSDP, and AWS Trainium, consistently cutting training cost and latency without sacrificing model quality.
