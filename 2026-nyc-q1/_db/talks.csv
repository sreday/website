,confirmed,Mandi Walls,1,1,PagerDuty,Mandi Walls.png,https://www.linkedin.com/in/mandiwalls/,,,,Reevaluating Post-Incident Reviews,"Post-Incident Review. Postmortem. Incident Report. Whatever you call them, they take time and resources, and sometimes you’re not even sure if anyone reads them.
The Post-Incident Review is a story. Maybe it’s a bit of a mystery, maybe it’s a feel-good story of redemption. Maybe it’s a buddy comedy. We produce these reports so that other folks in our organization can learn from the things we learned and hopefully not repeat our same mistakes.

Collecting the data and creating the story are work. We’ll talk about how PagerDuty has changed and adapted our methodology over time to produce better reviews that help more engineers get more out of the process and the assets that are produced.",,"Mandi Walls is a DevOps Advocate at PagerDuty and an Advisory Board Member for the Customer Experience Executive Program at Ithaca College. With more than a decade of experience across operations, automation, and community leadership - including nearly nine years in technical and community roles at Chef Software - she brings deep expertise in incident response, service reliability, and practitioner education.

,confirmed,Leon Adato,1,1,Cribl,Leon Adato.png,https://www.linkedin.com/in/leonadato/,,,,Looking back at a lifetime of poor tech choices,"Watching your technology choice go down the drain - because of broken promises, vendor implosion, or obsolescence - can feel like a career-ending experience. But in my experience there's usually a lot of good that comes out of those seemingly bad tech choices.",,"*A full speaker profile is available on [adatosystems.com](adatosystems.com/speaking/)*

In my sordid career, I have been an actor, bug exterminator and wild-animal remover (nothing crazy like pumas or wildebeests. Just skunks, snakes, and raccoons.), electrician, carpenter, stage-combat instructor, ASL interpreter, and Sunday school teacher. Oh, yeah, I've also worked with computers.

While my first keyboard was an IBM selectric, and my first digital experience was on an Atari 400, my professional work in tech started in 1989 (when you got Windows 286 for free on twelve 5¼” when you bought Excel 1.0). Since then I've worked as a classroom instructor, courseware designer, helpdesk operator, desktop support staff, sysadmin, network engineer, and software distribution technician.

Then, about 25 years ago, I got involved with monitoring. I've worked with a wide range of tools: Tivoli, BMC, OpenView, janky perl scripts, Nagios, SolarWinds,  DOS batch files, Zabbix, Grafana, New Relic, and other assorted nightmare fuel. I've designed solutions for companies that were modest (~10 systems), significant (5,000 systems), and ludicrous (250,000 systems). In that time, I've learned a lot about monitoring and observability in all it's many and splendid forms."
