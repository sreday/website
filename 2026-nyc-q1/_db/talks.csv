It also encompasses the shared culture of the speakers. With the proliferation of programming languages as well as the deeply held cultural beliefs of the community, it's easy to see that learning DevOps is like trying to learn a foreign language.

I will review five foundational hypotheses from the field of Second Language Acquisition and relate these hypotheses back to the world of DevOps.

,confirmed,Leon Adato,1,1,Cribl,Leon Adato DnD.png,https://www.linkedin.com/in/leonadato/,,,,What Tolkien Taught Me About Being an SRE,"J.R.R. Tolkien was a master of presenting real world situations in fantastical settings and making them both understandable and solvable. For many of us, Tolkien gave us the tools and the courage to conquer both the imagined fears and all-too-real obstacles standing in our way during childhood and adolescence.

BUT... If we take the time to really listen, Tolkien's Legendarium contains relevant and compelling lessons for seasoned I.T. practitioners. Seen in the right light (not just the setting sun of Durin's Day) we can find models for handling all types of technical challenges.

In this talk, I'll speak of far-sighted elves, underestimated hobbits, mysterious wizards, and of course of rings (Tolkien rather than token). But in the process I'll share a dragon's hoard of insights for the problems we find in our middleware, rather than Middle Earth.",,"*A full speaker profile is available on [adatosystems.com](adatosystems.com/speaking/)*

In my sordid career, I have been an actor, bug exterminator and wild-animal remover (nothing crazy like pumas or wildebeests. Just skunks, snakes, and raccoons.), electrician, carpenter, stage-combat instructor, ASL interpreter, and Sunday school teacher. Oh, yeah, I've also worked with computers.

While my first keyboard was an IBM selectric, and my first digital experience was on an Atari 400, my professional work in tech started in 1989 (when you got Windows 286 for free on twelve 5¼” when you bought Excel 1.0). Since then I've worked as a classroom instructor, courseware designer, helpdesk operator, desktop support staff, sysadmin, network engineer, and software distribution technician.

Then, about 25 years ago, I got involved with monitoring. I've worked with a wide range of tools: Tivoli, BMC, OpenView, janky perl scripts, Nagios, SolarWinds,  DOS batch files, Zabbix, Grafana, New Relic, and other assorted nightmare fuel. I've designed solutions for companies that were modest (~10 systems), significant (5,000 systems), and ludicrous (250,000 systems). In that time, I've learned a lot about monitoring and observability in all it's many and splendid forms."

While most organizations still evaluate AI success primarily through accuracy, latency, or model performance—often overlooking reliability, failure modes, and human trust.

In this talk, I will introduce AI Reliability Engineering (AIRE)—an emerging discipline that applies Site Reliability Engineering principles to AI-driven systems. I will explore how AI fails differently than traditional software, why AI-related incidents often go undetected, and how foundational SRE concepts such as SLOs, error budgets, observability, and graceful degradation must evolve to support reliable AI workloads at scale.",,"Akash Thakur is a Site Reliability Engineering leader and IT Architect with 17+ years of experience modernizing mission-critical systems across finance, healthcare, and the public sector.

In this talk, I’ll share how operating large cloud-native systems moved beyond dashboards, alert tuning, and postmortems to identify and act on those signals before incidents escalated to major severity. Using real production examples, I’ll walk through how logs, metrics, and traces can be combined with simple machine-learning techniques to surface early indicators of failure. This isn’t about replacing engineers with AI, it’s about evolving Ops practices to reduce alert fatigue, improve operational intuition, and give teams more quiet nights on call.",,"Adithya Jakkaraju is a Technical Architect at HCLTech and Founder of Fit Choice World, with prior experience leading engineering initiatives at USAA and consulting for Boston University.

,confirmed,Nandakishor Koka,1,1,Disney,Nandakishor Koka DnD.png,https://www.linkedin.com/in/nandakishorkoka/,,,,From Semantic Models to AI Agents: Why DevOps Discipline Matters,"As organizations deploy AI agents to answer questions, automate decisions, and take action on enterprise data, semantic models have quietly become part of the AI execution layer. Metrics, dimensions, joins, and business definitions no longer power just dashboards—they increasingly ground large language models, retrieval systems, and autonomous agents.
This shift raises a critical but underappreciated risk: AI agents inherit the operational weaknesses of the semantic models beneath them. Undocumented metric changes, unversioned definitions, and ungoverned joins do not merely produce incorrect dashboards—they propagate directly into AI reasoning, recommendations, and automated actions.
This talk argues that DevOps discipline is a prerequisite for trustworthy AI agents. We examine how CI/CD, versioning, observability, and approval workflows - traditionally applied to application code—must extend to semantic models to prevent AI hallucinations, reasoning drift, and silent failures. Attendees will learn why treating semantics as production infrastructure is essential for scaling AI safely, and how DevOps practices form the missing link between analytics platforms and reliable agentic systems.",,"Nandakishor Koka is a Principal Technical Architect at The Walt Disney Company, specializing in engineering management, data platforms, and large-scale analytics solutions.
