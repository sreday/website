This approach enhances scalability and efficiency, empowering teams to innovate rapidly in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) while maintaining the observability and reliability of systems.  

Site Reliability Engineers (SREs) have been working with AI for over a decade, utilizing AIOps tools to make sense of large amounts of observability data, thereby becoming familiar with AI/ML. As a result, they are a natural choice to tackle VLM platform hurdles.  

This session pours Site Reliability Engineering principles, patterns, and practices into AI/ML platforms using the ModelOps operating model to propose a few ideas for the following questions:

- How do SREs insert SLIs and SLOs for VLM-powered applications through the ModelOps pipeline?  
- What is observability for the new AI world?  
- How do SREs identify and eliminate toil in such environments by streamlining AI experiments?  

**Benefits to the ecosystem**  

- Share practices and patterns on how SREs insert SLIs and SLOs for AI/ML models and their serving app through the ModelOps pipelines  
- Explain the concept of observability in the new AI world  
- Learn how SREs identify and eliminate toil in such environments by streamlining AI experiments at the Edge  
- Understand how SREs can be the missing piece in the AI arena for a more efficient AI/ML platform that aligns with responsible AI policies

Too often, organizations invest in “magic tools” expecting instant results, only to end up with dashboards no one uses, alerts no one trusts, and teams that feel more burdened than empowered. True observability must start with strategy: aligning telemetry with business outcomes, defining maturity models, and using benchmarks to guide the journey.

This talk advocates for a shift in mindset: observability as the compass, not the destination. We’ll explore how maturity models and benchmarking frameworks can help organizations measure progress, identify gaps, and link engineering practices (like SLOs, automation, and postmortems) with business impact (resilience, reliability, customer trust). We’ll also cover challenges often amplified in enterprise contexts—such as tool-centric procurement, talent gaps, silos between Dev/Ops/Business, and uneven maturity across teams—and discuss how SREs can drive cultural alignment to overcome them.",,"I’m Tiago Dias Generoso, an SRE Leader with 25+ years of experience in hybrid cloud transformation, observability, and reliability at scale.

In 2011, I founded Instruct with my own resources, with the mission of transforming how companies operate their technology infrastructures. From the very beginning, I was directly involved in all areas of the company—designing projects, training professionals, negotiating with clients and partners, and helping to build a culture of technical excellence.

I was the first professional in Latin America to earn the Puppet Certified Professional certification, in 2012. Between 2015 and 2017, I spoke at PuppetConf in Portland, San Diego, and San Francisco, presenting Instruct’s success stories and experiences to an international audience. I also founded the Puppet Brazil Community and served as an official instructor for the Puppet Fundamentals, Practitioner, and Architect courses, training over 500 professionals throughout the years.

I have participated in various events such as TDC, DevOpsDays, and others, always speaking about automation, DevOps culture, and digital transformation. I’ve had the opportunity to lead projects delivered with excellence for companies such as Equinix, Itaú, and C&A.

From 2014 to 2020, under my leadership, Instruct exclusively represented in Brazil several global DevOps technology companies, including GitLab, Sonatype, Puppet Inc, CloudBees, HashiCorp, Rancher, and Mattermost.

More than technology, I believe in building long-term partnerships, delivering real value to clients, and forming teams that share a common purpose and passion for what they do.

**Principais lições de estar entre as maiores comunidades de tecnologia do país.**

Esta sessão provoca uma reflexão: muitos engenheiros de SRE e DevOps possuem vasto conhecimento, mas acabam sendo reconhecidos apenas dentro de suas empresas. Fora delas, ninguém os vê ou se inspira neles. Sabemos que quem não é visto é esquecido, e quem não compartilha não inspira.

Queremos mostrar como a comunidade, especialmente no contexto brasileiro, pode se tornar a ponte entre conhecimento e reconhecimento, fortalecendo tanto os profissionais quanto as empresas. Também trazemos um ponto importante: precisamos falar não apenas sobre histórias de sucesso, mas principalmente sobre falhas, pois é nelas que mais aprendemos e crescemos como comunidade.

Ao incentivar profissionais e empresas a se aproximarem ainda mais da comunidade no Brasil, transformando sua marca em algo memorável.

Nesta sessão, vamos abordar os seguintes tópicos:

**Conhecimento invisível não transforma**  
“Quem não é visto é esquecido. Quem não é lembrado, não inspira.”  
O problema do talento escondido

**“A comunidade precisa saber o que você sabe, não apenas a sua empresa.”**  
Visibilidade cria oportunidades

**“A marca não é só da empresa, é também da comunidade.”**  
O papel da comunidade no Brasil

**“A sua marca é a comunidade. A sua comunidade é a sua marca.”**  
O poder do fracasso

**“Histórias de sucesso inspiram. Histórias de fracasso transformam.”**  
O movimento de dentro para fora

**“A sua empresa se destaca mais quando os seus profissionais se destacam mais.”**  
Chamada para ação

**“Quem não é visto é esquecido. Quem não compartilha não inspira. Quem não inspira não transforma.”**
