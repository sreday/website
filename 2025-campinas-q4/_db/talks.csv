This approach enhances scalability and efficiency, empowering teams to innovate rapidly in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) while maintaining the observability and reliability of systems.  

Site Reliability Engineers (SREs) have been working with AI for over a decade, utilizing AIOps tools to make sense of large amounts of observability data, thereby becoming familiar with AI/ML. As a result, they are a natural choice to tackle VLM platform hurdles.  

This session pours Site Reliability Engineering principles, patterns, and practices into AI/ML platforms using the ModelOps operating model to propose a few ideas for the following questions:

- How do SREs insert SLIs and SLOs for VLM-powered applications through the ModelOps pipeline?  
- What is observability for the new AI world?  
- How do SREs identify and eliminate toil in such environments by streamlining AI experiments?  

**Benefits to the ecosystem**  

- Share practices and patterns on how SREs insert SLIs and SLOs for AI/ML models and their serving app through the ModelOps pipelines  
- Explain the concept of observability in the new AI world  
- Learn how SREs identify and eliminate toil in such environments by streamlining AI experiments at the Edge  
- Understand how SREs can be the missing piece in the AI arena for a more efficient AI/ML platform that aligns with responsible AI policies

SRE relies over Observability data to ensure the systems are performing as it should be. Automations depends on Observability insights to accurately remediate events. What about bring the Observability to Business side of history? Application Performance Monitoring (APM) tools capture more than the only 4 Golden Signals, let's leverage this and provide insights to the Business. In this presentation, I will explain how the Business Events can be captured from monitored sytems, and how to handle them in order to be presented and monitored, providing a real time source of insights at Business level.",,"I am currently working as Observability Consultant @ Kyndryl. IT Monitoring specialist since 2009. Started to play with APM tools in 2017 and presented to SRE world in 2020.

This session provokes a reflection: many SRE and DevOps engineers possess vast knowledge, but end up being recognized only within their companies. Outside, no one sees them or is inspired by them. We know that those who aren’t seen are forgotten, and those who don’t share, don’t inspire.

We want to show how the community, specially in the Brazilian context, can become the bridge between knowledge and recognition, strengthening both professionals and companies. We also bring an important point: we need to talk not just about success stories, but especially about failures, because it’s in them that we learn most and grow as a community.

By encouraging professionals and companies to get even closer to the community in Brazil and turn their brand into something memorable.

In this session, we will cover the following topics:

Invisible knowledge does not transform “Those who aren’t seen are forgotten. Those who aren’t remembered, don’t inspire.” The Hidden talent problem

“The community needs to know what you know, not just your company.” Visibility creates opportunities

“The brand isn’t just the company’s, it’s also the community’s.” The role of the community in Brazil

“Your brand is the community. Your community is your brand.” The power of failure

“Success stories inspire. Failure stories transform.” The inside-out movement

“Your company stands out more when your professionals stand out more.” Call to action

“Those who aren’t seen are forgotten. Those who don’t share, don’t inspire. Those who don’t inspire, don’t transform.”
