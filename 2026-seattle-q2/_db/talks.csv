Why? Because SRE is full of hidden traps — patterns that look like best practices on the surface but slowly erode reliability, burn out engineers, and stall progress.

In this talk, we’ll expose the 7 Deadly Traps of SRE, from the obsession with chasing “five nines,” to the cult of on-call heroism, to the false comfort of tooling and checklists. For each trap, we’ll unpack why it’s so seductive, how it quietly sabotages your team, and what to do instead.

You’ll walk away with a clearer lens on the pitfalls holding SRE organizations back, and a practical playbook to help your team escape firefighting mode and reclaim the true purpose of SRE: building systems - and cultures - that are resilient, scalable, and human-friendly.",,"Miko Pawlikowski is an SRE Author and a platform engineer at Quadrature.

As telemetry volumes grow and retention windows expand, SRE teams are being asked to run deeper, broader investigations—often under time pressure—on platforms that were designed for steady-state monitoring, not bursty incident response. Tightly coupled observability stacks bind storage, compute, and query together, forcing teams to overprovision infrastructure, limit retention, or accept degraded performance during incidents.

In this talk, we’ll explore why decoupling observability architectures is becoming essential for SRE teams operating at scale. Using a real incident investigation workflow, we’ll break down how separating data storage, compute, and interaction layers allows teams to keep fast, reliable monitoring while elastically scaling investigations when incidents occur.

We’ll connect these patterns to lessons learned in other data-intensive systems, but stay grounded in the day-to-day realities of on-call life: faster root cause analysis, fewer tradeoffs during incidents, and observability systems that hold up when you need them most.",,"Ben Hopp is an Architect at Imply, where he helps organizations decouple their observability stack with Imply Lumi. Based in Denver, Ben brings an extensive background in real-time data systems and observability, having worked on some of the world's largest data platforms. He specializes in helping teams break free from legacy observability stacks, enabling them to retain flexibility and control over their observability data while reducing costs and complexity."
