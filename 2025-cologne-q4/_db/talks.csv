,confirmed,Alayshia Knighten,1,1,Mondoo,Alayshia Knighten.png,https://www.linkedin.com/in/alayshia/,,,,Autonomy with Assurance for Reliability,"SREs are on the frontlines of uptime, performance, cost efficiency, and incident response. So, at times, policies for security and compliance often live in stale docs enforced inconsistently, if at all, until something breaks or someone has an audit. Policy as Code (PaC) replaces that mess with real-time automation right where the work happens.

We will discuss how PaC bridges the gap between security and operations by making policies transparent, codified, versioned, and customizable so you can enforce external standards (CIS, SOC 2, HIPAA) and your own internal rules (like requiring HA in prod but not in dev). You'll see how to apply policy intent consistently from the pipeline directly to runtime, giving teams proactive control, not reactive fire drills or unnecessary ""vibe killers"".

We'll walk through a full-lifecycle live demo to see the possibilities of PaC to: - Prevent misconfigurations with real-time checks - Enforce policies consistently across repos, infra, and runtime - Customize and codify controls that reflect unique needs - Control cloud costs through autoscaling, right-sizing, and cleanup - Unify security, dev, and ops with shared policies

What will we accomplish? Well, no more stale docs or arguments around policies, faster deploy, tighter cost controls, and safer infrastructure without slowing anyone down.",,"**Alayshia Knighten** is a seasoned engineering leader and customer success strategist with a strong background in DevOps, cloud architecture, and technical enablement.

,confirmed,Maxim Schepelin,1,1,Booking.com,Maxim Schepelin.png,https://www.linkedin.com/in/schepelin/,,schepelin,,"How to set SLOs, drive improvements, and make friends with business stakeholders","We, tech people, have internalized the concept of reliability so deeply that we don't need an explanation for why it's bad to have services failing in production. It doesn't matter what your software is doing — whether it controls train schedules, allows people to make money transfers, or serves funny pictures online.

We have invented an entire language to talk about reliability. We say things like, ""This service runs with three nines availability,"" ""Mean-Time-To-Repair for the website is 25 minutes,"" or ""This month, we consumed 80% of our error budget.""

And yet, it's a common struggle to convince business stakeholders to prioritize technical improvements.

In the past seven years, I've been responsible for products and services used by millions of people. I have been on call for years and have spent many nights resolving production incidents. From that experience, I learned how to make reliability a shared priority and prove, with data, the value of technical improvements.

In this session, I'll share techniques you can use to improve the reliability of your services, convince business stakeholders of the importance of reliability, and drive positive change in your organization.",,"Maxim Schepelin has been an engineering leader in various industries including game dev, e-commerce, and travel building teams capable of launching products from idea to world-scale. With over a decade of experience leading engineering teams, Maxim has mastered the art and science of management, as well as how to exit both Vim and Emacs. Maxim continues exploring ways to build effective engineering teams that deliver value at a sustainable pace."

This session introduces the concept of composable platforms, using modular, reusable components as the foundation for platform engineering. This talk will demonstrate how using Kratix, a workload-centric framework, and Backstage, an extensible developer portal, enables the creation of self-service platforms that balance standardization with adaptability. The session will detail platform design for scalability and governance, streamlining developer workflows through Backstage, and using Kratix Promises for varied workload requirements. Attendees will gain practical insights into building scalable and maintainable platforms through real-world examples, architectural patterns, and a live demonstration of a fully integrated Kratix-Backstage deployment.",,"Hossein is an experienced cloud computing professional with nearly a decade of expertise in distributed systems and cloud technologies. He began as a working student specializing in cloud automation at the Max Planck Institute, progressing to a full-time role focusing on on-premises cloud infrastructure and Docker. He built an on-premises Kubernetes platform in the industry and later honed his cloud and DevOps expertise as a senior consultant. As a tech lead, Hossein drives impactful projects, mentors platform engineers, and contributes to the community through talks and workshops."
,confirmed,Vlad Seliverstov,1,1,ClickHouse,Vlad Seliverstov.png,https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikeshi42/,,,,"How We Built ClickStack - an open source, open telemetry native Observability stack","Modern observability is built on a flawed foundation: three siloed pillars - logs, metrics, and traces - each powered by different engines with separate query models, storage formats, and operational costs. Users are forced to manually correlate across systems, accept duplication, or pay high SaaS bills. But what if observability is just a data problem? One that needs a general-purpose solution instead of purpose-built compromises? This talk argues that true observability requires fast, high-cardinality queries over unsampled data at scale and at low cost. Traditional search and metrics engines were not designed for this, but column-oriented databases are. We introduce ClickStack, a fully open source, OpenTelemetry-native observability stack built around ClickHouse. It provides fast, flexible querying and efficient storage, enabling real-time visibility without compromise.",,"Vlad Seliverstov leads the internal observability team at ClickHouse, overseeing the monitoring of ClickHouse Cloud, which handles over 100 petabytes of data and 500 trillion events. With more than a decade of SRE experience at Datadog, Dropbox, and Facebook, Vlad now focuses on building and scaling ClickHouse’s in-house observability platform."
,confirmed,Martin McLarnon,1,1,Coralogix,Martin McLarnon.png,https://www.linkedin.com/in/martin-mclarnon-280aba7/,,,,Using OpenTelemetry to Improve Service Level Objectives,"As systems grow more complex, engineering teams must move beyond guesswork when resolving production issues and instead focus on delivering consistent, measurable user value. This talk explores how OpenTelemetry empowers teams to define, measure and improve Service Level Objectives with precision and confidence.

Drawing on real-world experiences of a software team navigating the challenges of legacy code, cloud migration and production instability, this session demonstrates how OpenTelemetry helps teams gain the insights they need to reduce Mean Time To Resolution, understand root causes and proactively improve system reliability.

We’ll dive into hands-on examples using the OpenTelemetry Demo Application and show how to help turn technical metrics into business-aligned SLOs that actually mean something. Whether you're an SRE, developer, or engineering leader, this talk will give you the clarity—and tools—to move from reactive firefighting to proactive service reliability.",,"Martin McLarnon is an engineer with almost 30 years experience working in many different roles within IT. He has worked as a Network Manager, Software engineer, Cloud Architect, Engineering lead and worked as an engineering consultant before joining Coralogix."
