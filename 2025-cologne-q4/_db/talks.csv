,confirmed,Alayshia Knighten,1,1,Mondoo,Alayshia Knighten.png,https://www.linkedin.com/in/alayshia/,,,,Autonomy with Assurance for Reliability,"SREs are on the frontlines of uptime, performance, cost efficiency, and incident response. So, at times, policies for security and compliance often live in stale docs enforced inconsistently, if at all, until something breaks or someone has an audit. Policy as Code (PaC) replaces that mess with real-time automation right where the work happens.

We will discuss how PaC bridges the gap between security and operations by making policies transparent, codified, versioned, and customizable so you can enforce external standards (CIS, SOC 2, HIPAA) and your own internal rules (like requiring HA in prod but not in dev). You'll see how to apply policy intent consistently from the pipeline directly to runtime, giving teams proactive control, not reactive fire drills or unnecessary ""vibe killers"".

We'll walk through a full-lifecycle live demo to see the possibilities of PaC to: - Prevent misconfigurations with real-time checks - Enforce policies consistently across repos, infra, and runtime - Customize and codify controls that reflect unique needs - Control cloud costs through autoscaling, right-sizing, and cleanup - Unify security, dev, and ops with shared policies

What will we accomplish? Well, no more stale docs or arguments around policies, faster deploy, tighter cost controls, and safer infrastructure without slowing anyone down.",,"**Alayshia Knighten** is a seasoned engineering leader and customer success strategist with a strong background in DevOps, cloud architecture, and technical enablement.

It doesn't matter what your software is doing — whether it controls train schedules, allows people to make money transfers, or serves funny pictures online.

We have invented an entire language to talk about reliability. We say things like, ""This service runs with three nines availability,"" ""Mean-Time-To-Repair for the website is 25 minutes,"" or ""This month, we consumed 80% of our error budget.""

And yet, it's a common struggle to convince business stakeholders to prioritize technical improvements.

In the past seven years, I've been responsible for products and services used by millions of people. I have been on call for years and have spent many nights resolving production incidents. From that experience, I learned how to make reliability a shared priority and prove, with data, the value of technical improvements.

In this session, I'll share techniques you can use to improve the reliability of your services, convince business stakeholders of the importance of reliability, and drive positive change in your organization.",,"Maxim Schepelin has been an engineering leader in various industries including game dev, e-commerce, and travel building teams capable of launching products from idea to world-scale.

,confirmed,Vlad Seliverstov,1,1,ClickHouse,Vlad Seliverstov.png,https://www.linkedin.com/in/behemot/,,,,"How We Built ClickStack - an open source, open telemetry native Observability stack","Modern observability is built on a flawed foundation: three siloed pillars - logs, metrics, and traces - each powered by different engines with separate query models, storage formats, and operational costs. Users are forced to manually correlate across systems, accept duplication, or pay high SaaS bills. But what if observability is just a data problem? One that needs a general-purpose solution instead of purpose-built compromises? This talk argues that true observability requires fast, high-cardinality queries over unsampled data at scale and at low cost. Traditional search and metrics engines were not designed for this, but column-oriented databases are. We introduce ClickStack, a fully open source, OpenTelemetry-native observability stack built around ClickHouse. It provides fast, flexible querying and efficient storage, enabling real-time visibility without compromise.",,"Vlad Seliverstov leads the internal observability team at ClickHouse, overseeing the monitoring of ClickHouse Cloud, which handles over 100 petabytes of data and 500 trillion events.

,confirmed,Jose Gomez-Selles,1,1,VictoriaMetrics,Jose Gomez-Selles.png,https://www.linkedin.com/in/joseluisgomezselles/,,,,Modern Observability with OpenTelemetry in C++,"Do you still think that traces are those debug level logs to enable when something goes wrong? Do you think that this modern observability thingy is just another buzzword for other languages like javascript or go? Do you believe that ""std::cout"" is the best way to debug everything? Well, I do agree up to some point. But it does not scale that easily.

For modern, distributed systems, you will need to adopt modern observability. The path seems too complicated. But you are not alone! In this talk we'll demystify how to simply create metrics and distributed traces from a bunch of logs by using the OpenTelemetry standard and libraries. Metrics included too!

After describing the basics, Jose will also share an example he built to monitor many transactions in production without impacting performance. After this talk, you will be able to talk with higher confidence about OpenTelemetry, Jaeger, distributed tracing, Prometheus or VictoriaMetrics.",,"Jose is the Product Lead for VictoriaMetrics Cloud. With a focus on Observability and Sustainability, his work has been deeply related to the OpenTelemetry project, distributed tracing and power monitoring projects.

,confirmed,Ricard Bejarano,1,1,Cisco,Ricard Bejarano.png,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ricardbejarano/,,,,Speeding up Terraform caching with OverlayFS,"The Terraform plugin cache, unfortunately, does not support concurrent Terraform inits. This is a massive efficiency and performance loss for those who use Terraform at a big enough scale, since we're left with the following choices: - (A) Disable caching, and download gigabytes of providers off the Terraform Registry on every single init. - (B) Serialize all terraform init runs so they can safely share the cache, reducing the Terraform pipeline's throughput (and infuriating developers, been there, done that).

We didn't like our options here, so we got creative.

One day, everything clicked: OverlayFS!

OverlayFS is a Linux filesystem which combines the contents of multiple read-only directories and one writable layer on top, into a single volume, effectively implementing a sort of read-through cache within your filesystem. If you've ever used a live linux distribution, this is what those use. Containers use OverlayFS. CoreOS used OverlayFS to provide ephemeral /etc directories.

You rarely see such a low-level tool this high up the stack, so what is doing here?

We tweaked our workflow so that our plugin cache is mounted once per init using OverlayFS, which makes the centralized cache read-only (and thus, concurrent-safe) and gives Terraform a writable overlay where it can write whatever providers were missing. We then added a final, non-blocking step to feed back those new providers to the central cache (in a serial fashion using filesystem locking), effectively implementing a write-back cache.

After testing it on the lab, we promoted it to our production pipeline. After a couple rounds of plans to fill up the cache, we saw stunning results. Plan times dropped by -61%. Our concurrent plan capacity 10x'd because we were no longer saturating both the network (pulling) and the disk (writing providers). And after all, we didn't add much complexity to the setup anyway. We're using long-standing, reliable, kernel tech (overlayfs and flock) to address a shortcoming of a higher level tool like Terraform.",,"Ricard is a Lead Site Reliability Engineer at Cisco ThousandEyes' SRE team.
