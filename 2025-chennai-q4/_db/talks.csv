We began with the “easy path” of a third-party managed solution, but as we scaled, it quickly became our biggest bottleneck and a massive cost center.  

This session is our journey of taking back control. We’ll share the hard-earned lessons from hitting undocumented AWS limits, battling against opaque “black box” algorithms, and enduring production outages that forced us to innovate.  

**You’ll learn how we:**  
- Built custom controllers and predictive scaling  
- Slashed instance boot times by 75% through EBS optimization  
- Developed a “25-second miracle” shutdown process  

All of this allowed us not just to survive—but to thrive—in the chaos of a 100% Spot environment, achieving **99.99% uptime** while cutting compute costs by **60%**.  

This is how we transformed ECS from a simple orchestrator into a battle-hardened, intelligent platform.

At scale, they’re not just costly, they’re chaotic, emotionally draining, and often followed by postmortems that feel more like interrogations than opportunities to learn. What if the very process of incident response could be reimagined? Not as human vs. system, but as humans and AI working side by side?

This talk explores how the rise of AI-driven SRE agents is transforming both incident response and the culture of postmortems. These systems don’t just accelerate recovery; they act as impartial witnesses, documenting events in real time, surfacing context, and stripping away the bias that fuels blame. The result? A shift from “who missed what” to “how do we evolve our systems and practices?”

We’ll walk through: - Why traditional postmortems often fail in high-velocity, AI-heavy environments. - How AI-powered incident response changes the narrative from firefighting to foresight. - What happens when AI becomes the first responder and the cultural ripple effects it creates. - Practical steps to harness AI for faster resolution, deeper insights, and blameless learning loops. - How to quantify impact through metrics like mean time to resolution (MTTR), recovery consistency, and learning velocity and why measurement is critical to long-term success.

Attendees will leave with a fresh perspective: AI not as a replacement for SREs, but as a catalyst for resilience, psychological safety, and collective intelligence. In the age of AI, postmortems aren’t just about the past; they’re about future-proofing reliability.",,"I’m a Senior Engineering Manager with nearly two decades of experience building and leading platform and storage engineering teams.

  - Insufficient **insight into granular resource costs**
- Engineers can estimate **total costs** for compute instances and infrastructure stacks, but struggle with:

Why should SREs care about systems thinking applied in aviation safety engineering?  

Modern distributed systems face the same challenges as complex safety-critical systems: emergent failures, cascading outages, and the gap between system design and runtime behavior. While traditional monitoring focuses on known failure modes, aviation safety engineering provides systematic approaches to identify unknown risks.  

In this talk, you will learn how we applied MIT's **System-Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA)** — a methodology from aviation safety — to analyze reliability risks in a large-scale eCommerce platform processing millions of transactions daily.  

**What you will learn:**  
- How to map STPA concepts (hazards, constraints, control actions) to distributed systems components  
- A systematic framework for identifying cascading failure scenarios before they occur  
- Practical techniques for analyzing interactions between auto-scaling, load balancing, and circuit breakers  
- How cascading failures were reduced using insights from this analysis  
- Actionable methods you can apply to your own systems  

**Real examples covered:**  
- Circuit breaker coordination failures that created retry storms  
- Auto-scaling feedback loops that amplified rather than dampened failures  
- Security policy interactions that blocked legitimate traffic during incidents  
- Configuration drift detection that prevented silent reliability degradation  

This is not theoretical — we'll show concrete code examples, architecture diagrams, and actual incident data. You'll leave with a practical toolkit for systematic reliability analysis that goes beyond traditional SRE approaches.  

Whether you are dealing with microservices, serverless architectures, or hybrid cloud deployments, this methodology will help you build and maintain more resilient systems by thinking systematically about failure modes and control structures.  

**Perfect for:** SREs, Platform Engineers, and Engineering Managers who want to move beyond reactive incident response to proactive reliability engineering.
