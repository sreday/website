But this ease creates a hidden trap: teams instrument everything without considering the cost impact, leading to observability bills that consume 10-30% of infrastructure budgets. This talk exposes the real cost crisis behind modern telemetry data. We’ll examine actual cases where companies faced million-dollar annual monitoring bills, break down why high-cardinality metrics create exponential cost growth, and show proven techniques to cut expenses by 60-90% while maintaining full visibility. Through live demonstrations with real production scenarios, you’ll see how simple configuration mistakes create massive data volumes, then learn practical solutions: smart sampling that captures 100% of errors while reducing normal traffic by 95%, edge filtering that stops expensive data before it hits backends, and retention strategies that slash storage costs 60-80%. This isn’t about avoiding OpenTelemetry—it’s about using it smartly. You’ll gain actionable frameworks for cost-controlled implementation, team accountability models, and monitoring tools to prevent bill shock. Leave with battle-tested strategies from companies handling massive scale while controlling costs, plus a practical toolkit for cost-effective observability that finance teams will approve.",,"Mukta has survived 22 years of production outages, 3 startup exits and somehow still thinks observability is fun.

The traditional approach, while critical, often leaves SREs in a reactive stance, hindering proactive innovation and true operational excellence.

This session will explore the transformative emergence of SRE AI Agents – intelligent, conversational systems designed to augment human SRE capabilities and fundamentally reshape how we build, monitor, and maintain reliable systems. We will delve into how these AI agents, powered by advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and sophisticated data correlation, are moving beyond simple automation to become true ""co-pilots"" for reliability engineers.",,"I am passionate about building reliable systems that just work—for everyone, every time.

This session reframes “observability 3.0” as a sociotechnical practice that fuses human-driven SRE with pragmatic AIOps. We’ll explore how rich telemetry (metrics, logs, traces, profiles, and user signals) plus topology and domain context evolves from passive visibility into an active decision system. On the human side, SREs define intent via SLOs, failure hypotheses, and reliability narratives and design for explainability, guardrails, and post-incident learning. On the AI side, we’ll discuss how correlation, anomaly detection, event deduplication, and LLM-powered triage can cut noise and accelerate root-cause discovery, while runbook automation and safe auto-remediation handle the boring, reversible fixes.

Expect concrete patterns: telemetry pipelines that feed feature stores, knowledge graphs that reflect real service topology, feedback loops that keep models honest, and governance that ensures AI augments not overrides SRE judgment.

Why should SREs care about systems thinking applied in aviation safety engineering?  

Modern distributed systems face the same challenges as complex safety-critical systems: emergent failures, cascading outages, and the gap between system design and runtime behavior. While traditional monitoring focuses on known failure modes, aviation safety engineering provides systematic approaches to identify unknown risks.  

In this talk, you will learn how we applied MIT's **System-Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA)** — a methodology from aviation safety — to analyze reliability risks in a large-scale eCommerce platform processing millions of transactions daily.  

**What you will learn:**  
- How to map STPA concepts (hazards, constraints, control actions) to distributed systems components  
- A systematic framework for identifying cascading failure scenarios before they occur  
- Practical techniques for analyzing interactions between auto-scaling, load balancing, and circuit breakers  
- How cascading failures were reduced using insights from this analysis  
- Actionable methods you can apply to your own systems  

**Real examples covered:**  
- Circuit breaker coordination failures that created retry storms  
- Auto-scaling feedback loops that amplified rather than dampened failures  
- Security policy interactions that blocked legitimate traffic during incidents  
- Configuration drift detection that prevented silent reliability degradation  

This is not theoretical — we'll show concrete code examples, architecture diagrams, and actual incident data. You'll leave with a practical toolkit for systematic reliability analysis that goes beyond traditional SRE approaches.  

Whether you are dealing with microservices, serverless architectures, or hybrid cloud deployments, this methodology will help you build and maintain more resilient systems by thinking systematically about failure modes and control structures.  

**Perfect for:** SREs, Platform Engineers, and Engineering Managers who want to move beyond reactive incident response to proactive reliability engineering.
