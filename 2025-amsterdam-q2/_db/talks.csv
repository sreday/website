,confirmed,Sohan Maheshwar,1,1,AuthZed,Sohan Maheshwar.png,https://www.linkedin.com/in/sohanmaheshwar/,,,,"How Google built a Consistent, Global Authorization System (and you can too!)","Google Zanzibar is the singular authorization service that powers permissions and sharing across all Google properties, including Docs, YouTube, and Cloud IAM. Creating a consistent, global-scale authorization system that can process ""more than 10 million client queries per second” is not a trivial task. The talk will cover how the paper lays out an engineer-friendly blueprint for building a highly scalable distributed system with flexible consistency guarantees.

This talk will start with foundational knowledge of Relationship Based Access Control (ReBAC) and then cover the technical implementations behind Zanzibar - How Google solved for correctness, scale and speed. The presentation will cover the different APIs for interacting with the system and also a deep-dive into how the “New Enemy” problem was solved. The talk will conclude with how you can use open source tools to build authZ into your application.K",,

Deadlocks? They're the bane of modern software development, especially with tools like Kafka, Kubernetes, and microservices. Testing helps, but it rarely finds all the subtle, timing-dependent bugs.

Imagine having a way to mathematically verify your design's logic before you code it. That's TLA+. Developed by Turing Award winner Leslie Lamport, it's a language for specifying and checking algorithms, especially concurrent ones. The catch? Most intros are dense and theoretical.

This session is different. It's TLA+ for the rest of us – the software engineers in the trenches. We'll skip the deep math and focus on practical application. You'll learn what TLA+ is, how to model simple concurrent interactions, and how it can save you from deployment disasters by catching design flaws early. Walk away ready to explore how formal methods can become your secret weapon for building bulletproof systems.

Key Takeaways:

- Recognize the inherent difficulties in validating concurrent designs.
- Get a practical, hands-on feel for TLA+ concepts and syntax.
- Understand how TLA+ helps prevent race conditions and deadlocks at the design stage.
- Be inspired to apply formal verification techniques to real-world problems.",,"Consulting software architect / lead dev. Specialized in backend performance optimization. Wrote THE French book on Go: https://osinet.fr/go/en/ - Main non-tech business interests: media and e-commerce.

This talk explores how OpenTelemetry empowers teams to define, measure and improve Service Level Objectives with precision and confidence.

Drawing on real-world experiences of a software team navigating the challenges of legacy code, cloud migration and production instability, this session demonstrates how OpenTelemetry helps teams gain the insights they need to reduce Mean Time To Resolution, understand root causes and proactively improve system reliability.

We’ll dive into hands-on examples using the OpenTelemetry Demo Application and show how to help turn technical metrics into business-aligned SLOs that actually mean something. Whether you're an SRE, developer, or engineering leader, this talk will give you the clarity—and tools—to move from reactive firefighting to proactive service reliability.",,"Martin McLarnon is an engineer with almost 30 years experience working in many different roles within IT. He has worked as a Network Manager, Software engineer, Cloud Architect, Engineering lead and worked as an engineering consultant before joining Coralogix."

Watch as I transform a complex terraform module with zero test coverage into a battle-hardened, production-ready component in under 30 minutes.

You'll learn how to:

Leverage AI to quickly generate comprehensive test cases across unit, mock, and integration tests Build test suites that validate the full spectrum of your Terraform modules from configuration to outputs Implement advanced testing patterns with mock providers to simulate AWS resources Create maintainable test coverage reports that highlight gaps and provide actionable insights Adopt a test-driven development approach that scales with your infrastructure We'll showcase real examples, demonstrating how this approach has reduced our testing time by 90% while increasing code quality and developer confidence. Whether you're new to Terraform testing or looking to enhance your existing test suites, you'll walk away with actionable techniques to implement immediately.",,"Dharani Sowndharya is a Lead DevOps Engineer at Equal Experts, with nearly a decade of experience in the tech industry.
