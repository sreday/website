There’s noise, complexity, and a constant stream of change. And while we’ve come a long way with observability, it still leans heavily on human foresight. Logs, metrics, alerts, they’re all things we had to think of ahead of time. But when we don’t? That’s where blind spots are born.

Ambient agents try to shift that model. These are always-on, proactive teammates who don’t wait for a prompt. They listen to everything happening in production. They surface things we’d likely miss.

In this talk, we’ll dive into what it takes to bring an ambient agent into your stack, how it listens, learns, and acts, and why this might just be the layer of intelligence your system’s been missing.",,"Pooné Mokari is the CEO and co-founder of Ewake.ai, an AI Reliability Teammate on a mission to bring real peace of mind to engineering teams.

OpenTelemetry,"Observability is the cornerstone of reliable systems. It lets teams identify and resolve issues before they impact a broader group of users. Yet building an ideal observability stack is far from easy. It demands time and effort, instrumenting every app, service, and component that emits telemetry. Many teams default to “Store’em All - just in case”, logs that no one reads, traces that no one queries, metrics that never inform action. The result? Costs escalate, operational clarity fades, and ROI on observability tends to plateau or even decline. So, shouldn’t we be asking ourselves: are we really investing in observability, or just paying for some distributed noise?

The issue isn’t lack of telemetry; it’s unchecked volume without purpose. This talk explores the telemetry pipeline as a strategy to take back control. At the OpenTelemetry Collector level, we can filter, transform, sample, redact sensitive data, and route telemetry with intent. The goal is to extract clear business value from every signal and every dollar spent. By aligning observability with outcomes, we get an adaptive, efficient, and cost-aware setup. Whether you’re just starting out or operating at scale, this talk will show how to turn observability into a strategic asset instead of a liability.",,"Yash is a software engineer and researcher with a deep interest in distributed systems.

Promises of intelligent autoscaling, self-tuning systems, and AI-assisted remediation are everywhere. But how do these claims hold up in real-world Kubernetes environments?

In this deeply technical session, the latest generation of AI-powered features and patterns will be benchmarked and stress-tested in the context of platform operations. From scaling decisions to observability-driven automation and adaptive infrastructure behavior, the focus will be on how these systems perform under load, how they handle edge cases, and what the operational overhead truly looks like.

What if there was a better way? I mean, AI is everywhere nowadays, what if we used it to solve these problems? Let's talk about AIOps and, through real-world case studies and industry research, see why it enables companies to reduce their MTTR by 62%, cut their alert noise by 91%, and predict 87% of potential service degradations — before they impact customers. We will take a journey through the evolution of AIOps: from early AI analytics, to the rise of GenAI, and taking us to the latest promised savior: Agents.

So, at times, policies for security and compliance often live in stale docs enforced inconsistently, if at all, until something breaks or someone has an audit. Policy as Code (PaC) replaces that mess with real-time automation right where the work happens.

We will discuss how PaC bridges the gap between security and operations by making policies transparent, codified, versioned, and customizable so you can enforce external standards (CIS, SOC 2, HIPAA) and your own internal rules (like requiring HA in prod but not in dev). You'll see how to apply policy intent consistently from the pipeline directly to runtime, giving teams proactive control, not reactive fire drills or unnecessary ""vibe killers"".

We'll walk through a full-lifecycle live demo to see the possibilities of PaC to: - Prevent misconfigurations with real-time checks - Enforce policies consistently across repos, infra, and runtime - Customize and codify controls that reflect unique needs - Control cloud costs through autoscaling, right-sizing, and cleanup - Unify security, dev, and ops with shared policies

What will we accomplish? Well, no more stale docs or arguments around policies, faster deploy, tighter cost controls, and safer infrastructure without slowing anyone down.",,"**Alayshia Knighten** is a seasoned engineering leader and customer success strategist with a strong background in DevOps, cloud architecture, and technical enablement.

,confirmed,Attila Szakacs,1,1,Axoflow,Attila Szakacs.png,https://www.linkedin.com/in/alltilla/,,,,Counting What You Care About in Your Security Data Pipeline,"Traditional syslog systems have long been opaque — exporting minimal, fixed-format metrics that rarely reflect what users actually care about. AxoSyslog, a high-performance fork of syslog-ng, has taken a different path: not only adopting native Prometheus metrics, but also enabling metric emission directly from the user’s log processing logic.

In this talk, I’ll share how we transitioned from CSV-style global and per-driver metrics to full Prometheus integration. But more importantly, I’ll explore a less common mindset: treating metrics not as static artifacts of a system, but as programmable, user-defined views of what matters. Users can emit fine-grained, label-rich metrics from log routing logic itself — for example, tracking per-tenant message volume, labeling metrics with custom log or environment related info, or observing how often certain fields are missing.

We’ll walk through: * What syslog metrics looked like historically (and why they fell short). * Our journey to integrating Prometheus natively. * How update_metric() works and why it's powerful. * Real-world use cases where dynamic metrics made debugging and policy enforcement dramatically easier.

If you want to make observability accessible in deeply traditional parts of the stack — or want to let users code their own metrics — this talk is for you.",,"Founding Engineer at Axoflow, leading the dataplane team, specializing in scalable log ingestion and processing pipelines for enterprise and cloud-native environments.

,confirmed,Piotr Zaniewski,1,1,vCluster,Piotr Zaniewski.png,https://www.linkedin.com/in/piotr-zaniewski/,,Piotr1215,,"Instant KAI Sandboxes with vCluster: Multi-Tenant, Multi-Scheduler GPU Sharing","**Session Overview**  
Kubernetes offers many ways to share GPUs, but a single, cluster-wide scheduler often forces trade-offs between utilization, stability, and team autonomy. This talk shows how vCluster makes the NVIDIA Kubernetes AI Scheduler (KAI) run as an opt-in service for each tenant—so platform teams can raise GPU density while keeping operations predictable.  

**What We’ll Cover**  
- Problem statement – why mixed workloads leave GPUs under-used and complicate on-call  
- vCluster fundamentals – lightweight control planes that isolate scheduling logic, not hardware  
- KAI at a glance – fractional GPU allocation, gang queues, topology awareness  
- Live demonstration – two vClusters on one host  

**Key Takeaways**  
- A reproducible pattern for running different schedulers side-by-side  
- Practical steps to increase GPU utilisation without adding more clusters  
- An isolation model that lets teams experiment safely  

**Why It Matters**  
As GPU demand grows, platform engineers must balance cost efficiency with reliability. Combining vCluster and KAI delivers both—turning idle accelerators into productive capacity while preserving operational control.

This talk introduces the Intent Graph—a new visualization paradigm that traces the propagation of design decisions across system layers, from infrastructure to application logic to business outcomes. The Intent Graph makes dependencies between architectural choices, test coverage gaps, and runtime anomalies explicit and navigable. We walk through real-world scenarios where misaligned design intent caused failures—even when metrics looked green. Using techniques from MIT's STAMP/STPA, causal inference, and Generative AI, we show how to move from metric dashboards to intent-aware observability fabric. This talk will resonate with those seeking to build truly self-explaining systems.

It maps how design decisions, quality trade-offs, and business goals flow across the system stack, from infrastructure to app to outcomes. When this flow is broken, the system may still ""work""—but it works wrong.

What you'll learn:

How to capture intent traces at design time How to correlate runtime telemetry to intent deviation How to prevent false positives/negatives in alerting through purpose-aware thresholds How to respond to incidents based on drift from intent, not just error rates

This is observability with semantics. And it is what SRE needs next.
