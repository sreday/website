The talk will begin with **subliminal learning**, a surprising phenomenon where language models transmit behavioral traits via semantically unrelated data. In our main experiments, a ""teacher"" model with some trait *T* (such as liking owls or being misaligned) generates a dataset consisting solely of number sequences. Remarkably, a ""student"" model trained on this dataset learns *T*. This occurs even when the data is filtered to remove references to *T*. We observe the same effect when training on code or reasoning traces generated by the same teacher model. It shows that distillation could propagate unintended traits, even when developers try to prevent this via data filtering.
Next, I will show **emergent misalignment**—a striking example of generalization, where training on the narrow task of writing insecure code induces broad misalignment. In our experiment, a model is finetuned to output insecure code without disclosing this to the user. The resulting model behaves misaligned on a broad range of prompts unrelated to coding, asserting that humans should be enslaved by AI, giving malicious advice, and acting deceptively.
Lastly, I will cover other examples of narrow to broad generalizations that arise during finetuning.
The talk will mainly cover selected topics from the papers:

However, as real-world tasks become more complex, classical RAG systems are performing adequately but are now encountering clear limitations.

The result is a system that can answer simple questions but cannot execute workflows.
This talk introduces Agentic-RAG, an emerging paradigm that combines retrieval with autonomous agents capable of reasoning, iterating, and making decisions. We will break down the core architectural components—intent interpretation, planning, multi-hop retrieval orchestration, tool-augmented reasoning, and context synthesis—and show how they transform RAG from passive fetch-and-generate into an active, adaptive problem-solving pipeline.",,"Porimol is an MLOps Engineer at Roche, currently focused on architecting advanced Agentic-RAG workflows for healthcare.
