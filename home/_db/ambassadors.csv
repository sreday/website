Kat Gaines,"Senior Manager, Developer Relations",PagerDuty,https://www.linkedin.com/in/katgaines/,"I was glad to be part of starting the PagerDuty and SREday partnership and to support events that stay thoughtful and well scoped. These conferences create space for focused discussions without losing their sense of warmth. Having spoken at many events over the years, it’s been meaningful to watch SREday reach more places around the world. I’m grateful for the care that goes into it and look forward to what comes next.",United States - West,All SREday locations,Kat Gaines.png
Matt Schillerstrom,Director Product Management and Product Marketing,Harness,https://www.linkedin.com/in/matt-schillerstrom-722b5559/,"One of the very first SREday Ambassadors, I helped bring the conference to San Francisco and kick things off on the West Coast. I have been friends with Miko and Mark since way back, so being part of this from the early days felt natural and exciting. I am genuinely happy to help kick off the SREday + Harness partnership and see where this community keeps growing next.",United States - West,SREday San Francisco,Matt Schillerstrom.png
Mandi Walls,DevOps Advocate,PagerDuty,https://www.linkedin.com/in/mandiwalls/,"I’ve been following SREday since the early days and have had a front row seat to how it keeps evolving. Helping get the PagerDuty partnership off the ground and speaking at events organized by Miko and Mark since 2021, including conf42, has shown me how intentional this community really is. There’s a clear focus on substance and real conversations. I’m genuinely excited about what’s ahead.",United States - East,All SREday locations,Mandi Walls.png

I have spoken at most of the locations along the way, which gave me a front row seat to how the conversations and the community keep evolving. I am here because I care about helping the developer community grow in a way that stays practical, curious, and human.",United States - East,All SREday locations,Leon Adato.png
Daniel Afonso,Senior Developer Advocate,PagerDuty,https://www.linkedin.com/in/danieljcafonso/,"I met Mark and Miko at SREday London in 2025, which somehow led to us packing out the PagerDuty office in Lisbon not long after. We had so much interest that we sold out very fast, which is a pretty good problem to have. The whole thing was loud, fun, and slightly chaotic in the best way. I’m very curious to see how much bigger SREday gets.",Portugal,All SREday locations,Daniel Afonso.png
Bas van Alphen,IT Chapterlead SRE,ING,https://www.linkedin.com/in/basvanalphen/,"I am involved in organizing SREday Amsterdam at ING, mainly focusing on the practical side of making it all run smoothly. That meant logistics, speaker coordination, and yes, making sure everyone was well fed and caffeinated. I also joined a panel discussion on the state of reliability practices and tooling in banks, which sparked some honest and interesting conversations about where we are, what still hurts, and what is slowly getting better.",Netherlands,SREday Amsterdam,Bas van Alphen.png
William Ravensbergen,Developer Advocate,ING,https://www.linkedin.com/in/william-ravensbergen/,"I co-organized the very first SREday hosted at ING Amsterdam. I worked closely with the SREday team to shape a speaker lineup that felt thoughtful, practical, and genuinely useful for people doing the work day to day. Being part of this from the inside was energizing, and I am genuinely happy to keep showing up and helping the SRE community grow in ways that feel grounded and welcoming.",Netherlands,"SREday Amsterdam, SREday London",William Ravensbergen.png

Through my work at GuhaTek, I help organizations operationalize reliability by connecting SRE principles, observability, and chaos engineering to real business outcomes, not just tooling. For me, SRE is about engineering discipline, shared responsibility, and continuous improvement, and communities like SREday help make that real at scale. We’re proud to support this initiative and committed to growing the SREday community across cities in India!",India,SREday Chennai,Balaji Venkatesan.png
Clarence Selestin,SRE Manager,Ford Motor Company,https://www.linkedin.com/in/clarence1982/,"Reliability at scale only matters when it shows up for real users, and that’s why SREday India resonates with me. Leading global SRE for Ford’s eCommerce platforms has reinforced that resilience is built through strong engineering fundamentals, operational discipline, and shared ownership across teams. Events like SREday create the space to move beyond theory, talk honestly about failures, and learn what actually works in production.Excited to see the community grow across cities as more practitioners come together to raise the bar on reliability.",India,SREday Chennai,Clarence Selestin.png

As Co-Founder of GuhaTek, I work closely with engineering teams on SRE, SLO-driven reliability, chaos engineering, and observability, with a strong focus on learning from real incidents and building resilient systems. I believe meaningful engineering communities are built on trust, openness, and shared learning, not just tools or frameworks. We’re excited to support SREday India and look forward to growing this community across cities in India!",India,SREday Chennai,Siva Bagavathi.png
Birol Yildiz,CEO & Co-Founder,Ilert,https://www.linkedin.com/in/birolyildiz/,"What started as a casual conversation at SREday Amsterdam turned into a brand new adventure in Germany.
