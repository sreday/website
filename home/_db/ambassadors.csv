Through my work at GuhaTek, I help organizations operationalize reliability by connecting SRE principles, observability, and chaos engineering to real business outcomes, not just tooling. For me, SRE is about engineering discipline, shared responsibility, and continuous improvement, and communities like SREday help make that real at scale.

Leading global SRE for Ford’s eCommerce platforms has reinforced that resilience is built through strong engineering fundamentals, operational discipline, and shared ownership across teams. Events like SREday create the space to move beyond theory, talk honestly about failures, and learn what actually works in production. I’m glad to support this first India edition in Chennai and excited to see the community grow across cities as more practitioners come together to raise the bar on reliability.",India,SREday Chennai,Clarence Selestin.png
