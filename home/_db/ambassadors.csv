What Mark and Miko build consistently delivers real value, not just content for content’s sake. Helping organize SREday Redmond and Seattle was a natural extension of that, and it reinforced how much thought goes into making these events genuinely useful.",United States - West,All SREday locations,Peter De Tender.png

Kyle Forster,Founder & CEO,RunWhen,https://www.linkedin.com/in/kyforster/,"What started as RunWhen sponsoring a handful of SREdays quickly grew into a long term partnership, and it’s been genuinely fun to watch SREday expand into multiple cities across Europe and the US while keeping the same thoughtful, practitioner driven feel.

Daniel Afonso,Senior Developer Advocate,PagerDuty,https://www.linkedin.com/in/danieljcafonso/,"I met Mark and Miko at SREday London in 2025, which somehow led to us packing out the PagerDuty office in Lisbon not long after. We had so much interest that we sold out very fast, which is a pretty good problem to have. The whole thing was loud, fun, and slightly chaotic in the best way. I’m very curious to see how much bigger SREday gets.",Portugal,All SREday locations,Daniel Afonso.png
