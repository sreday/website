,confirmed,Yash Verma,1,1,Independent,Yash Verma.png,https://www.linkedin.com/in/yashvardhanee/,,,,Radius: The Cloud Native Wingman You Need to Know About,"How do you abstract platform complexity without sacrificing control, visibility, or flexibility across multi-cloud environments? As modern architectures push toward microservices, Kubernetes, and GitOps, the gap between development and operations continues to widen. Enter Radius, not your typical mathematical calculations around circles, but a CNCF sandbox project. It offers a universal, open-source framework that standardizes application development and deployment while decoupling workloads from infrastructure. This session explores how Radius enables platform teams to define reusable, compliant patterns and gives developers self-service workflows, without losing governance. With native GitOps integration and support for cloud and on-prem, Radius delivers consistency, collaboration, and operational clarity. Learn how to build scalable, future-ready platforms that balance autonomy and control through a shared, declarative abstraction layer.",,"Yash is a software engineer and researcher with a deep interest in distributed systems. His focus is on observability and performance, areas where he constantly seeks new insights. As an active advocate of OpenTelemetry, Yash contributes to both the project and the wider community. Outside of tech, he’s an avid explorer, whether in the kitchen experimenting with new recipes or traveling the world to taste diverse cuisines."

Traditional security tools struggle to keep up. In this session, we’ll explore how eBPF powers next-gen observability and security by running directly in the Linux kernel. Using Cilium for networking and Tetragon for runtime security, we’ll trace system calls, enforce behavior-based policies, and detect threats in real time—all without sidecars or agents. By the end, you’ll understand how to turn the kernel into your security ally.",,"Hello, I'm Mert Polat.

I'm currently working as an Cloud and Platform Engineer at Sufle. I started my career as a Jr. DevOps Engineer at Zip Turkey, where I gained extensive experience in Infrastructure and DevOps domains. At Duzce MEKATEK, I worked in the software team for an autonomous vehicle project and took on a leadership role. Additionally, I honed my skills in technologies like Docker, Kubernetes, and Ansible during a DevOps internship at Formica.

I am passionate about technology and knowledge sharing, so I write various articles for @DevopsTurkiye and @Bulut Bilişimciler publications on Medium.

I graduated from Duzce University with a degree in Computer Programming, and I'm currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in Management Information Systems at Anadolu University.

,confirmed,Daniel Afonso,1,1,PagerDuty,Daniel Afonso.png,https://www.linkedin.com/in/danieljcafonso/,,danieljcafonso,,Full Service Ownership & The Lifecycle of a Service,"Services are the backbone of our systems. They are the pieces that make up our businesses—whether they are literal microservices or functional components of a traditional application, we can’t do the computer thing without services.

When it comes to a service in your company or organization, who’s responsible for it? The cast of characters involved in the lifecycle of a service is more than just software engineers. It can include program managers, product owners, sustainability teams (SREs/operations engineers), and business stakeholders, just to name a few.

Topics covered in this talk include: – Defining what a service means to you and your organization – Roles in service ownership – What are you observing about your service? – How you want a team to respond to a service outage or incident – Managing your service in production – Tuning your service – Understanding how the service impacts the business",,"Daniel Afonso is a Senior Developer Advocate at PagerDuty, SolidJS DX team member, Instructor at Egghead.io, and Author of State Management with React Query. Daniel has a full-stack background, having worked with different languages and frameworks on various projects from IoT to Fraud Detection. He is passionate about learning and teaching and has spoken at multiple conferences around the world about topics he loves. In his free time, when he's not learning new technologies or writing about them, he's probably reading comics or watching superhero movies and shows."

Region-wide outages and performance degradations can render your applications non-responsive. And what if you're dealing with downstream systems that aren't as scalable as your system and can't handle the load you put on them?

The bottom line is that many things can go wrong, and they often do at the worst of times. The goal of building resilient systems is not to prevent failures, but to design systems that can withstand them.

In this talk, we will examine several practices and architectural patterns that can help you build more resilient serverless architectures, such as multi-region design, employing DLQs and surge queues and cell-based architectures.

We'll also explore how chaos experiments can help us identify failure modes before they happen in production.",,"Yan is an experienced engineer who has run production workload at scale on AWS since 2010. He has been an architect and principal engineer in a variety of industries ranging from banking, e-commerce, sports streaming to mobile gaming. He has worked extensively with AWS Lambda in production since 2015. Nowadays, he splits his time between advancing the state of serverless observability as a Developer Advocate at lumigo.io and helping companies around the world adopt serverless as an independent consultant.

Yan is also an AWS Serverless Hero and a regular speaker at user groups and conferences internationally. He is the author of Production-Ready Serverless and co-author of Serverless Architectures on AWS, 2nd Edition. And he keeps an active blog at theburningmonk.com and hosts a serverless-focused podcast at realworldserverless.com."
