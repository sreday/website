,confirmed,Yash Verma,1,1,Independent,Yash Verma.png,https://www.linkedin.com/in/yashvardhanee/,,,,Radius: The Cloud Native Wingman You Need to Know About,"How do you abstract platform complexity without sacrificing control, visibility, or flexibility across multi-cloud environments? As modern architectures push toward microservices, Kubernetes, and GitOps, the gap between development and operations continues to widen. Enter Radius, not your typical mathematical calculations around circles, but a CNCF sandbox project. It offers a universal, open-source framework that standardizes application development and deployment while decoupling workloads from infrastructure. This session explores how Radius enables platform teams to define reusable, compliant patterns and gives developers self-service workflows, without losing governance. With native GitOps integration and support for cloud and on-prem, Radius delivers consistency, collaboration, and operational clarity. Learn how to build scalable, future-ready platforms that balance autonomy and control through a shared, declarative abstraction layer.",,"Yash is a software engineer and researcher with a deep interest in distributed systems. His focus is on observability and performance, areas where he constantly seeks new insights. As an active advocate of OpenTelemetry, Yash contributes to both the project and the wider community. Outside of tech, he’s an avid explorer, whether in the kitchen experimenting with new recipes or traveling the world to taste diverse cuisines."

Traditional security tools struggle to keep up. In this session, we’ll explore how eBPF powers next-gen observability and security by running directly in the Linux kernel. Using Cilium for networking and Tetragon for runtime security, we’ll trace system calls, enforce behavior-based policies, and detect threats in real time—all without sidecars or agents. By the end, you’ll understand how to turn the kernel into your security ally.",,"Hello, I'm Mert Polat.

I'm currently working as an Cloud and Platform Engineer at Sufle. I started my career as a Jr. DevOps Engineer at Zip Turkey, where I gained extensive experience in Infrastructure and DevOps domains. At Duzce MEKATEK, I worked in the software team for an autonomous vehicle project and took on a leadership role. Additionally, I honed my skills in technologies like Docker, Kubernetes, and Ansible during a DevOps internship at Formica.

I am passionate about technology and knowledge sharing, so I write various articles for @DevopsTurkiye and @Bulut Bilişimciler publications on Medium.

I graduated from Duzce University with a degree in Computer Programming, and I'm currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in Management Information Systems at Anadolu University."
,confirmed,Daniel Afonso,1,1,PagerDuty,Daniel Afonso.png,https://www.linkedin.com/in/danieljcafonso/,,danieljcafonso,,Full Service Ownership & The Lifecycle of a Service,"Services are the backbone of our systems. They are the pieces that make up our businesses—whether they are literal microservices or functional components of a traditional application, we can’t do the computer thing without services.

When it comes to a service in your company or organization, who’s responsible for it? The cast of characters involved in the lifecycle of a service is more than just software engineers. It can include program managers, product owners, sustainability teams (SREs/operations engineers), and business stakeholders, just to name a few.

Topics covered in this talk include: – Defining what a service means to you and your organization – Roles in service ownership – What are you observing about your service? – How you want a team to respond to a service outage or incident – Managing your service in production – Tuning your service – Understanding how the service impacts the business",,"Daniel Afonso is a Senior Developer Advocate at PagerDuty, SolidJS DX team member, Instructor at Egghead.io, and Author of State Management with React Query. Daniel has a full-stack background, having worked with different languages and frameworks on various projects from IoT to Fraud Detection. He is passionate about learning and teaching and has spoken at multiple conferences around the world about topics he loves. In his free time, when he's not learning new technologies or writing about them, he's probably reading comics or watching superhero movies and shows."
