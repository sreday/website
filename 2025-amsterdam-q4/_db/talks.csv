This tight coupling drives up costs, makes integrations painful, and slows teams down. But it doesn’t have to be this way.
In this talk, we’ll explore how SRE teams can benefit from a more modular approach to observability—one inspired by the evolution of Business Intelligence. Just as BI stacks evolved to separate ETL, data warehouses, and dashboards, observability stacks can be designed around clear boundaries: interoperable tools, technology-neutral query layers, and plug-and-play storage.
You’ll learn why decoupled observability architecture is essential for cost control, agility, and tool flexibility—and how to move toward a stack that meets the real-world needs of today’s SRE teams.",,"Peter Marshall is a technology leader and community builder with a background in developer relations, data architecture, and digital transformation.

So, at times, policies for security and compliance often live in stale docs enforced inconsistently, if at all, until something breaks or someone has an audit. Policy as Code (PaC) replaces that mess with real-time automation right where the work happens.

We will discuss how PaC bridges the gap between security and operations by making policies transparent, codified, versioned, and customizable so you can enforce external standards (CIS, SOC 2, HIPAA) and your own internal rules (like requiring HA in prod but not in dev). You'll see how to apply policy intent consistently from the pipeline directly to runtime, giving teams proactive control, not reactive fire drills or unnecessary ""vibe killers"".

We'll walk through a full-lifecycle live demo to see the possibilities of PaC to: - Prevent misconfigurations with real-time checks - Enforce policies consistently across repos, infra, and runtime - Customize and codify controls that reflect unique needs - Control cloud costs through autoscaling, right-sizing, and cleanup - Unify security, dev, and ops with shared policies

What will we accomplish?

,confirmed,Kevin van der Vlist,1,1,ING,Kevin van der Vlist.png,https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevinvandervlist/,,,,From Incident Response to Preventive Mitigation: Leveraging CodeQL and LLMs at Scale,"After recovering from incidents, we must ensure that effective mitigation measures are in place to prevent similar issues in the future.

However, clearly expressing the characteristics of past problems and identifying similar occurrences across large codebases is a significant challenge, especially at the scale of ING.

We present our approach to encoding known and ING-specific (anti)patterns as CodeQL queries. These queries are used to assess both individual and multiple repositories, enabling us to pinpoint risks and reach out directly to the responsible teams, rather than broadcasting generic warnings to everyone.

A key challenge is the volume of findings: a single query can yield hundreds of results, overwhelming engineering teams if not managed carefully. To address this, we define a process that not only assesses findings but also generates actionable patches and contextual advice. By integrating Large Language Models (LLMs), we combine the specific context of each code finding with the surrounding source code and high-level problem descriptions, resulting in tailored, practical recommendations for engineers.

We translate incident learnings and ING-specific anti-patterns into CodeQL queries, making them reusable and scalable. For each finding, we use LLMs to generate context-aware advice and, where possible, code patches. This ensures recommendations are both actionable and relevant to the code owner.

By combining static analysis with LLM-driven advice, we turn past mistakes into valuable lessons, foster professional growth, and continuously improve our engineering community.

Region-wide outages and performance degradations can render your applications non-responsive. And what if you're dealing with downstream systems that aren't as scalable as your system and can't handle the load you put on them?

The bottom line is that many things can go wrong, and they often do at the worst of times. The goal of building resilient systems is not to prevent failures, but to design systems that can withstand them.

In this talk, we will examine several practices and architectural patterns that can help you build more resilient serverless architectures, such as multi-region design, employing DLQs and surge queues and cell-based architectures.

Rather than focusing on failure injection alone, we explore how to leverage existing knowledge, validate known truths, and foster confidence in complex systems.

In the first part, we deconstruct common myths around Chaos Engineering and reframe its core principles. Learn how aligning chaos practices with reliability goals can transform the way your organization perceives and applies these techniques—by emphasizing structured validation over blind experimentation.

The second part brings theory into practice with a hands-on framework that reimagines chaos experiments as self-feeding, iterative loops—mirroring the scientific method. We introduce the concept of continuous verification, drawing parallels with integration testing, and show how Chaos Engineering can seamlessly integrate into the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) through a shift-left approach.

This talk explores the invisible enemies of reliability — cognitive biases that affect how engineers make decisions, solve problems, and respond to incidents. From confirmation bias during outages to groupthink in postmortems, we’ll unpack six specific mental shortcuts that silently undermine your systems.

Each bias is brought to life with real-world engineering examples, memorable visuals, and practical strategies you can apply immediately.

The reaction should be a failure in the tests. If there is no reaction, it means that the tests are not effective enough, meaning their assertions are broad and imprecise.

 

Mutation testing comes to the rescue for this specific challenge. This methodology changes the source code and then runs the unit tests against the mutated codebase. The generated report helps the engineer find where the weak spots in the tests are.

 

In this talk we will cover the theory behind this methodology, followed by a live demo where code which could be described as ""100% tested"" would still be subject to bugs and how its related tests can be improved.

 

This approach will offer a way for engineers to gain confidence in their code and especially in their tests. With a high test strength, source code will not only be strong but also malleable to modifications, with the safe guardrails of unit tests protecting them from introducing bugs.

 

The audience will learn how to write more efficient and resilient tests due to the mutation tests giving them a different perspective on their code quality, compared to the normal tests.
