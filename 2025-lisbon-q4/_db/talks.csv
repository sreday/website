,keynote,Joao Freitas,1,1,PagerDuty,Joao Freitas.png,https://www.linkedin.com/in/mccricardo/,,,,Keynote: The Rise of AI-driven SRE,"As modern software systems become increasingly complex, Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) teams face mounting operational challenges. Traditional methods—manual triage, rule-based alerts, fragmented dashboards—are no longer sufficient to manage the scale and dynamism of today's distributed architectures. In response, the ""AI-driven SRE"" paradigm is emerging: agentic systems that emulate expert diagnostic reasoning, integrate service knowledge, and maintain a continuous improvement loop across the incident management lifecycle. Unlike legacy automation or general-purpose AI solutions, these SRE agents are tailored for the investigative, causal-analysis workflows unique to SRE—incorporating telemetry, change history, service topology, and post-incident knowledge. In their most advanced form, they transition from advising to semi-autonomous or fully autonomous operation, triaging incidents, hypothesizing root causes, executing remediation actions, and learning from outcomes in production.

In this talk we will walkthrough recent research and industry initiatives that embody this shift, highlight key architectural patterns (multi-agent coordination, model-context protocols, observability pipelines), and discuss avenues for safe adoption—governance, auditability, and gradual autonomy. In doing so, we argue that AI-driven SRE is poised not merely to augment reliability engineers but to transform how reliability is engineered and operated at scale.",,"João Freitas is General Manager and Engineering Lead for AI at Pager Duty.

Along this journey, we’ve faced a unique set of challenges that go far beyond writing Terraform modules or defining cloud resources.
This talk explores what happens when the abstractions created for scalability and flexibility begin to clash with user experience. From bridging the knowledge gap between the underlying technology and end users, to managing the complexity that comes with more configuration options, I’ll share what worked, what didn’t, and the lessons learned.
We’ll also dive into one of the hardest aspects of maintaining large IaC systems: testing. How do you ensure reliability when every configuration combination can generate a different infrastructure outcome? And how can we build meaningful observability that focuses not only on infrastructure health, but also on giving users actionable insights to optimize performance and control costs?
If you’re building or scaling a product powered by IaC, this talk provides a candid look at the trade-offs, challenges, and strategies to make your platform both powerful and user-friendly.",,"Luis is passionate about the Cloud-Native ecosystem, with Kubernetes playing a central role in all the projects he has worked on.

,confirmed,Rajat Gupta,1,1,Paymenttools,Rajat Gupta.png,https://www.linkedin.com/in/rajatguptarg/,,rajatgupta712,,Building an Actionable Runbook Platform,"**Actionable runbooks** close the gap between *“what to do”* and *“doing it.”*  
This talk shows how to design and ship a runbook platform where steps can be clicked and executed safely during incidents.  

**What the system does**  
- Create and manage runbooks with tags and Markdown.  
  - Blocks include: instruction, command, API call, conditional, and timer.  
- Execute a full runbook or a single block with outputs captured in history.  
- Use RBAC, encrypted credential store, versioning, and containerized environments to keep execution safe and repeatable.  
- Core entities and API surface: `Runbook`, `RunbookVersion`, `Block`, `ExecutionJob`, `Credentials`, plus endpoints for runbooks, versions, execution, and credentials.  

**Architecture at a glance**  
- React SPA communicates with a FastAPI backend and MongoDB.  
- An execution worker runs jobs and streams results.  

**Demo flow**  
1. Create a runbook with tags and Markdown instructions.  
2. Add a command block and an API call block that uses a stored credential.  
3. Assign a custom Docker execution environment to the runbook.  
4. Run a single block, then run the entire runbook and watch outputs land in history.  

**What you will learn**  
- Design principles for truly actionable runbooks and how they differ from static docs.  
- How to implement safe execution with RBAC, audit, and container isolation.  
- Patterns for versioning and rollbacks so teams can iterate without fear.  
- How this approach complements existing incident tooling and industry guidance on making runbooks actionable  
  ([Incident][1], [resources.rundeck.com][2]).  

**Who should attend**  
- SRE, platform, security, and backend engineers who own on-call and incident response.  
- Engineering managers who want safer self-service for ops tasks.
