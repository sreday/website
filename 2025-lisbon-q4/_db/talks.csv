,confirmed,Rajat Gupta,1,1,Paymenttools,Rajat Gupta.png,https://www.linkedin.com/in/rajatguptarg/,,rajatgupta712,,Building an Actionable Runbook Platform,"**Actionable runbooks** close the gap between *“what to do”* and *“doing it.”*  
This talk shows how to design and ship a runbook platform where steps can be clicked and executed safely during incidents.  

**What the system does**  
- Create and manage runbooks with tags and Markdown.  
  - Blocks include: instruction, command, API call, conditional, and timer.  
- Execute a full runbook or a single block with outputs captured in history.  
- Use RBAC, encrypted credential store, versioning, and containerized environments to keep execution safe and repeatable.  
- Core entities and API surface: `Runbook`, `RunbookVersion`, `Block`, `ExecutionJob`, `Credentials`, plus endpoints for runbooks, versions, execution, and credentials.  

**Architecture at a glance**  
- React SPA communicates with a FastAPI backend and MongoDB.  
- An execution worker runs jobs and streams results.  

**Demo flow**  
1. Create a runbook with tags and Markdown instructions.  
2. Add a command block and an API call block that uses a stored credential.  
3. Assign a custom Docker execution environment to the runbook.  
4. Run a single block, then run the entire runbook and watch outputs land in history.  

**What you will learn**  
- Design principles for truly actionable runbooks and how they differ from static docs.  
- How to implement safe execution with RBAC, audit, and container isolation.  
- Patterns for versioning and rollbacks so teams can iterate without fear.  
- How this approach complements existing incident tooling and industry guidance on making runbooks actionable  
  ([Incident][1], [resources.rundeck.com][2]).  

**Who should attend**  
- SRE, platform, security, and backend engineers who own on-call and incident response.  
- Engineering managers who want safer self-service for ops tasks.
