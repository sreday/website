,confirmed,Yuri Oliveira Sa,1,1,OllyGarden,Yuri Oliveira Sa.png,https://www.linkedin.com/in/yurioliveirasa/,,,,Beyond 'Done': Strategies for Improving OpenTelemetry Instrumentation Quality,"Many teams stop improving OpenTelemetry once basic data is collected, but low-quality instrumentation limits observability. This talk shares practical strategies to enhance signal consistency, completeness, and correlation, plus methods for validating and maintaining quality over time. Learn how to move beyond “done” to build reliable, insightful OpenTelemetry instrumentation.",,"In his professional path, Yuri Sa has always been involved in helping companies achieve the next level of automation in their infrastructure environment. Throughout his 15 years of experience, he worked in critical environments as SysAdmin, SRE, and DevOps Engineer. One of his central beliefs is that all barriers between Development and Operations teams should be removed; for that reason, he decided to contribute to open-source projects focused on observability in the past few years."
,confirmed,Rajat Gupta,1,1,Paymenttools,Rajat Gupta.png,https://www.linkedin.com/in/rajatguptarg/,,rajatgupta712,,Building an Actionable Runbook Platform,"**Actionable runbooks** close the gap between *“what to do”* and *“doing it.”*  
This talk shows how to design and ship a runbook platform where steps can be clicked and executed safely during incidents.  

**What the system does**  
- Create and manage runbooks with tags and Markdown.  
  - Blocks include: instruction, command, API call, conditional, and timer.  
- Execute a full runbook or a single block with outputs captured in history.  
- Use RBAC, encrypted credential store, versioning, and containerized environments to keep execution safe and repeatable.  
- Core entities and API surface: `Runbook`, `RunbookVersion`, `Block`, `ExecutionJob`, `Credentials`, plus endpoints for runbooks, versions, execution, and credentials.  

**Architecture at a glance**  
- React SPA communicates with a FastAPI backend and MongoDB.  
- An execution worker runs jobs and streams results.  

**Demo flow**  
1. Create a runbook with tags and Markdown instructions.  
2. Add a command block and an API call block that uses a stored credential.  
3. Assign a custom Docker execution environment to the runbook.  
4. Run a single block, then run the entire runbook and watch outputs land in history.  

**What you will learn**  
- Design principles for truly actionable runbooks and how they differ from static docs.  
- How to implement safe execution with RBAC, audit, and container isolation.  
- Patterns for versioning and rollbacks so teams can iterate without fear.  
- How this approach complements existing incident tooling and industry guidance on making runbooks actionable  
  ([Incident][1], [resources.rundeck.com][2]).  

**Who should attend**  
- SRE, platform, security, and backend engineers who own on-call and incident response.  
- Engineering managers who want safer self-service for ops tasks.  
",,"I’m a Senior Engineering Manager at Paymenttools in Berlin, leading platform teams across SRE and Security. I focus on reliability, observability, Kubernetes, and policy as code, and I drive green-field work from idea to production. Lately I’ve been applying GenAI into the SRE and platform domains. I like clear processes, data-backed decisions, and practical solutions, and I write for peers to share what works and what doesn’t."
